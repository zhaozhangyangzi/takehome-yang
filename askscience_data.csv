0,Post viral cough: why does it get worse after you get better?,"Tl;dr: why is your cough during an upper respiratory infection not as bad as your post viral cough? (In the absence of asthma or secondary infection)

Hey folks! This question is perplexing me and I can’t seem to find a specific answer via google.

I think I understand why post viral cough happens in the first place: Your mucosa are already inflamed from the infection and immune response. Your cough reflex is hypersensitive because it kicked into gear to fight the virus. As such, the smallest irritations (such as post nasal drip or cold air) are far more likely to trigger a cough. This takes a while to calm down. 

What I don’t understand is the severity and duration. Post viral coughs can take way longer to clear than the virus or any other symptoms. And people often complain of their post viral cough being more frequent, dry, painful and disruptive than when they were sick.

This has been my experience at least. Sometimes I have a cold and barely cough at all. Then as soon as my nose clears up, coughing fits keep me awake at night for 2 weeks. (And I have no comorbidities or secondary infections.) 

So what’s going on there? Is there like an inflammation cycle? Are my observations totally off?

27,Black Lives Matter,"**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. 

When 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.

When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.

These disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. 

Change requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. 

However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.

These numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.

This lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.

It is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change.

50,"Similar to increasing wealth gap, are we experiencing an increasing educational gap? Are well-educated getting more educated and under-educated staying under-educated?","Edit: Thanks everyone for many different perspectives and interesting arguments!

One statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and I'm glad it is taking place.

Another point brought up was education and degrees. In this question, I don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

I realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. Though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. One just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. It also begs the question: What is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

An educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. However, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**.

FAQ:

> Where do they come from?

The source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> How fast do they go?

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).

> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

The 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).

In 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.

> Does this mean we can control gravity?

No. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> What's the practical application?

[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)

117,Why do we hear about breakthroughs in cancer treatment only to never see them again?,"
I often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:

1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs’ effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media’s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people’s hopes for a cure to get revenue.

2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?

3. What are the major hurdles to actually “curing” cancer universally?

Here are a few examples of “breakthrough” articles and research going back to 2009, if you’re interested:

1. There is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. When they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. There is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness.

There are lots of ways you could raise your temperature a little (or a lot if you’re not careful), such as showers, baths, hot tubs, steam rooms, saunas, etc... 

My understanding is that a fever helps fight infection by acting in two ways. The higher temperature inhibits the bug’s ability to reproduce in the body, and it also makes some cells in our immune system more effective at fighting the infection.

****

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the great comments, everyone. This kinda blew up so I figured I'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments I found particularly enlightening. Obviously I'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. This can just function as a TLDR.

First of all, I'm gonna limit what I put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like Egyptian, Mayan, Greek and Latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken English and IPA usage. Really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* Latin, Greek and Mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. Several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* Greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken Egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the Rosetta Stone. When Greeks invaded Egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. Many Egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (This I found super interesting) Names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this Greek language infusion. This means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* In the example of Tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of Coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (Tut, Ankh, and Amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. The appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: As an example, ""Tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""Tawat 'ankhu qaman"" ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).

* Finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. Someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. This part seems kind of confusing and I might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. See u/Ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point.

188,"The Human Genome Project cost $2.7 billion. 20 years later, it costs <$1000 to sequence the genome. Was the cost of the project fundamentally necessary for subsequent progress, or could we have ""waited"" for the technology to become cheaper?","I'm very much a clueless layman, but I'm learning about genetics for the first time. I don't mean this in any sort of combative way–the Human Genome Project had countless benefits that we can't possibly track, and I'd imagine $2.7 billion is a trifle compared to its broader impact. 

My question is just narrowly about the way that genome sequencing has dropped rapidly in cost. Was it fundamentally necessary to first use these exorbitantly pricey methods, which provided the foundation for the future research which would make it affordable? Or are the two questions inherently separate: the Human Genome Project gave us a first, initial glimpse at our mapped out genome, and then a decade later separate technological developments would make that same task much cheaper (as is commonly the case in science and technology).

The ""could we have waited"" in the title is probably misleading–I really don't mean any sort of  value judgment (the project sounds enormously important), I purely mean ""could"" in a narrow hypothetical (not, ""would it have been a good idea to wait"", which I highly doubt).",Biology,2020-07-12 04:51:10,Ziddletwix,12778,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hpt7ab/the_human_genome_project_cost_27_billion_20_years/

I now have a cold. Coughing, sneezing, phlegm, headache, etc. I am also very weak and can barely walk my body across the room. What specifically is causing this? Are all the body's resources tied up in fighting the virus or has the virus itself actually somehow made my muscles weak?

In a week or so, I'll be better and back to normal, but it's weird how even though my muscles have not had time to deteriorate due to lack of use, it seems like they're only one third there.

*Summary:* We are a team of astronomers running a campaign called the Pale Red Dot. We have found definitive evidence of a planet in orbit around the closest star to Earth, besides the Sun. The star is called Proxima Centauri and lies just over 4 light-years from us. The planet we've discovered is now called Proxima b and this makes it the closest exoplanet to us and therefore the main target should we ever develop the necessary technologies to travel to a planet outside the Solar System. 

Our results have just been published today in Nature, but our observing campaign lasted from mid January to April 2016. We have kept a blog about the entire process here: [www.palereddot.org](http://www.palereddot.org/) and have also communicated via Twitter @Pale_Red_Dot and Facebook [https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/](https://www.facebook.com/palereddot/)

420,AskScience AMA Series: We have hints of life on Venus. Ask Us Anything!,"An international team of astronomers, including researchers from the UK, US and Japan, has found a rare molecule - phosphine - in the clouds of Venus. On Earth, this gas is only made industrially or by microbes that thrive in oxygen-free environments. Astronomers have speculated for decades that high clouds on Venus could offer a home for microbes - floating free of the scorching surface but needing to tolerate very high acidity. The detection of phosphine could point to such extra-terrestrial ""aerial"" life as astronomers have ruled out all other known natural mechanisms for its origin.

Signs of phosphine were first spotted in observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), operated by the East Asian Observatory, in Hawai'i. Astronomers then confirmed the discovery using the more-sensitive Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), in which the European Southern Observatory (ESO) is a partner. Both facilities observed Venus at a wavelength of about 1 millimetre, much longer than the human eye can see - only telescopes at high altitude can detect it effectively.

Details on the discovery can be read here: https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2015/

We are a group of researchers who have been involved in this result and experts from the facilities used for this discovery. We will be available on Wednesday, 16 September, starting with 16:00 UTC, 18:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time), 12:00 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). Ask Us Anything!

442,"If iron loses its magnetism at around 1400°F, how is the earths core magnetic?","After reading a comment in another thread about heavy metals in our solar system I saw a comment stating that our core made of mostly molten iron is why we survive solar radiation (due to its magnetism).

Im not sure why I never queationed this before, but as an amateur blacksmith, I regularly heat iron up to a non magnetic temperature in order to quench and harden it.

Also I know there is supposed to be nickel in the outer core which is also a non magnetic metal.

So I did some research and found that it was believed to be cause by the dynamo effect caused by the swirling plasma within the core, but from my experience with plasma most of which comes from my home made arc furnace and of course the occasional plasma cutter (neither of which I have ever noticed creating any type of magnetic field), I dont quite understand how it alone, even if it were swirling, could create such a large magnetic field since the magnetic field of the earth is several hundreds of miles from the core.  I also wondered how such a field were able to penetrate the miles of ferrous materiels found above it so easily while not magnetizing them.

Then I started thinking about other things that cause magnetism like electro magnets and such and wondered if maybe our cold iron cored moon plays a role in our magnetism by reacting with surface metals which are cool enough to be more receptive to magnetism.

So I researched that and found that the moon has little to no magnetism and unlike earth, its magnetism is non polar so there is no way the moon is the culprit of our magnetism because if it were then it seems it would also have to have magnetic properties similar to ours, and it doesn't.

Which brings me back to my original question only revised, how is our inner core of Iron plasma magnetic, and why is important that it is Iron plasma as opposed some other form of plasma if the swirling truly does create the magnetic field somehow?

Edit:  Thanks to everyone for some very insightful responses.  I really appreciate the help even if it is just to satisfy a curiosity.

The major points I have taken away from this is that we live in a universal sea of magnetic fields and our conductive and swirling outer core amplifies and redirects this field like a giant electromagnet powered by several forms of energy such as residual heat, earths rotation, radiation and even the moon.  We are are pretty sure the inner core is superheated crystaline Iron with some other heavy metals in much smaller amounts like uranium which only work to keep things nice and toasty in the center so the liquid outer core can keep swirling and the electromagnetic fields can make some really awesome lights near the north and south poles and if the swirling stopped we would all die because the earth is not a permanent magnet.

In the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.

More information on the scientists conducting the research can be found [here](https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from James Cook University. Dr. Sandra Abell and professor Bill Laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.

489,Prosthetics: Can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?,"I understand (or at least, I think I do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  Let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  At no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... If he are she is born this way I presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  I am sure that technology will continue to advance so I guess I am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

The inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  He utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  A very heart warming video.  Many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  But one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

Any thoughts?

That seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  I will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. While I am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

499,Why exactly are overweight people at higher risk when they get infected with COVID-19?,"I have seen many mentions, that being overweight is one of the risk factors to have more sever case of COVID-19. I wonder, why exactly does this happen. Is it related to the fact that overweight people are often less active (don't exercise much, have sedentary lifestyle, etc - so, for example, their respiratory system is more susceptible to the impact of the virus) or does it have something to do with being overweight in general (hormones, metabolism or something else) ? 

&#x200B;

Why do I ask: I'm overweight, I started to exercise regularly since spring and dropped about 9 kg/19 pounds so far. Such tasks like going upstairs or running are much easier now, but my weight is still above the norm for my age/height. So I wonder if I've lowered the risk of getting the severe form of covid-19. (It's just curiousity, I'll continue to follow social distancing and other rules in any case.)

Edit: Thanks for all the answers, I totally didn't expect the post to blow up. Now I have much to read, thanks to all people willing to explain. (And to some kind strangers for the awards). 

And huge respect to AskScience moderators for clearing all these ""because fat is bad"" useless and/or insulting answers, that I see in mobile notifications. 

And yes, I understand that being overweight or obese is unhealthy in general, no need to remind me about this. My question was about that particular case with covid-19. More detailed understanding of how it works, helps me to stay motivated. (The covid threat wasn't the main reason for my desire to lose weight, I have many other inner and outer reasons for that. It just happened that staying at home on lockdown helped me to start eating healthier and working out more regularly).",COVID-19,2020-11-15 10:39:15,Aglavra,8760,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/juqulz/why_exactly_are_overweight_people_at_higher_risk/

552,"If the universe is an hypertorus, is it possible that we receive the light from a star twice ?","I recently read an article in a French science magazine stating that the universe might be an hypertorus (Euclidian, finite and borderless). They represented it using a cube in which when you exit through one side you actually come back in from the opposite one.

I made a drawing to make my question clearer : [Drawing](http://imgur.com/a/C84eq)

 *The three panels on the left represent the universe in 2D and when you move through a side you come back through the opposite one. The star is any star and the black dot represents the Earth. The arrow is the light emited from the star.*

 *The three right panels represent what we see from the surface of the Earth.*

 * The first 2 pictures are straight-forward the star lits us directly and we see it in the sky as it was at the moment the light was emited

 * On the second line of the ""comic"" you can see the light traveling through the right side and coming back out of the left one and then hitting us. What we then see in the sky is a second star that appears to be way further than the first one and way older, when it is in fact the same one !

 * On the third line I was imagining a scenario where the light goes through the loop several times. We would then see the star as it was a very long time ago, or even maybe witness it's birth ?


**To recap**

It sounds crazy but would it be possible that we see the same star at different moments of it's life span ?

**EDIT**

Christ this blew up over the week-end while I was away, I will try to read everything as soon as possible. 

Also thank you for the gilding ! Even if I have no clue what it does, I feel like someone now !

553,Why is it so important to finish the whole course of antibiotics?,"Hey guys, so I got into this debate with my friend who told me he stops taking his antibiotics once he starts feeling better. Naturally I was horrified but when he kept questioning it, I couldn’t really explain why it was so important for him to take the full course. Could anyone explain what the dangers are when people don’t finish their prescribed course of antibiotics?

EDIT: thank you so much for all the comments and resources! I’ll pass them on to my friend and hopefully he’ll believe it’s more than just “big pharma propaganda” lol.

EDIT 2: For everyone saying my friend sucks, I completely understand, but my friend is not a scientist. He was ignorant to how antibiotics work and why it was important to keep taking medicine after he stopped feeling sick. I would say his opinion represents the majority of people who don't really think deeply about these things.

592,Has there ever been evidence of spatial dimensions beyond the three we can perceive?,"Lately I've become extremely interested in spatial dimensions beyond length, width, and height, reading Flatland, etc.

I was thinking about something recently. If we have a universe of 2D space that us as three-dimensional beings can look at, we can interact with that universe but only in a distorted kind of sense. A 3D object casts a 2D shadow. A 3D object moving through the plane of a 2D universe would appear to a 2D being as something that appears from nowhere, changes shape, and eventually disappears into nothingness.

We haven't found a 2D plane of existence to test this out on, of course, and, as far as I know, We haven't ever seen a four-dimensional object cast a three-dimensional ""Shadow."" At least, as far as I know.

I've seen some people postulate about 5, 6, even 10 spatial dimensions. But if these dimensions actually existed, shouldn't we have seen, by now, some form of evidence of them? Or have we seen three-dimensional ""shadows"" of four-dimensional objects and I'm just unaware?",Physics,2017-12-20 07:06:48,DELETED,8207,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7l1x9j/has_there_ever_been_evidence_of_spatial/

604,Is there any record of any object from earth being ejected to space by natural forces?,"I have tried to summarise the comments that answer this question the best with citations: 

**1. The Moon**

>u/Chlorophilia: a very good example of an 'object' that was ejected into space from the Earth, in the form of our moon. Simulations (e.g. [Canup & Asphaug 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35089010.pdf), [Cuk & Stewart 2012](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6110/1047/tab-pdf)) and evidence from lunar stable isotopes (e.g. [Wiechert et al., 2001](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5541/345)) strongly support the theory that our moon formed when a large (possibly Mars-sized) object collided with the proto-Earth about 4.5 billion years ago, flinging out a vast amount of proto-Mantle and proto-Crustal material into space, a large proportion of which eventually coalesced to form the moon.

 **2. A Moon rock which is actually an Earth meteorite**

> u/yellowstone10: Some researchers have concluded that a 2-cm chip of a Moon rock collected by the crew of Apollo 14 was probably ejected from the Earth about 4 billion years ago. [https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/ancient-earth-rock-found-moon)  
>  
>u/foramsgalorams: In January of this year, it was announced that a rock sample from Apollo 14 collected in 1971 looks very much like it has a piece of rock from Earth within it! This would make it an Earth meteorite which struck the Moon and became emplaced in some of the lunar rock. This would have happened like a game of Solar System pinball, as it would take a large meteorite striking Earth to knock some terrestrial matter free and all the way to the Moon. Radiometric dating puts them at about 4.1 billion years old, so very early in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history but importantly not as old as the Theia-Earth impact event which formed the Moon itself, so there was a distinct subsequent event which led to this lunar oddity. You can read more on the details [here](https://eos.org/articles/apollo-may-have-found-an-earth-meteorite-on-the-moon) and the research paper was published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X19300202). 

**3. Moldavite – Rocks which got sent to space by meteor impact and dropped back**

> u/aa_unfiltered: Moldavite is a stone that looks like green glass. It formed millions of years ago when a meteorite hit earth in Germany and ejected molten material high into space where it cooled and formed bubbles inside that have pressure 25 times lower than at sea level. [https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite](https://www.arkadiancollection.com/what-is-moldavite) 

**4. Hydrogen and Helium** 

>u/SlowerThanLightSpeed: ""Jean's escape"" describes the method by which a tiny percentage of molecules in a gas get accelerated to escape velocity simply by chance collision sequences with other gas molecules: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric\_escape#Jeans\_Escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape#Jeans_Escape)   
>  
>Atmospheric escape of hydrogen on Earth is due to Jeans escape (\~10 - 40%), charge exchange escape (\~ 60 - 90%), and polar wind escape (\~ 10 - 15%), currently losing about 3 kg/s of hydrogen.\[10\] The Earth additionally loses approximately 50 g/s of helium primarily through polar wind escape. Escape of other atmospheric constituents is much smaller,\[10\] but a Japanese research team in 2017 found some oxygen ions on the moon that came from the Earth.\[11\] 

**Also Volcanoes apparently DO NOT have enough force to eject matter into space** 

>u/Clovis69: volcanos don't have the force to do that and generally a ""supervolcano"" is just a volcano thats bigger, longer, huge volumes of magma and gases to eject. Most eruptions, even from supervolcanos never have gas or ejecta break through the tropopause - [http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction](http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/ozone-destruction) 
>
>u/KnowanUKnow : It's unlikely that any volcano exploded with enough force to eject solid matter into space. The most powerful volcanic explosions eject matter at around 1km/sec. Subtract air resistance and then add thermal buoyancy and you can get up to about 50-60 km high. Not high enough, since space is kinda-sorta defined as starting at 100 km up. I thought Krakatoa could do it, since that volcano literally exploded, shooting 45 cubic km of material upwards with the force of 200 megatons of TNT. But even that isn't enough. It literally blew a 2625 foot high mountain into the air with the force of over 13,000 Hiroshimas (or 4 Tsar Bombs) and even that isn't enough. There's something called a Verneshot, which is a hypothetical build up of volcanic gasses below a continental rift which could, in theory, eject matter into sub-orbital space, but a Verneshot is theoretical and has never been observed.

Edit: Wow, the replies on here are really fantastic, thank you guys!

TIL: the iconic ""dive-bomber diving"" sound we all know is actually the sound of a [WWII German Ju87 Stuka Dive Bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_87). It was the sound of a siren placed on the plane's gear legs and was meant to instil fear and hopefully make the enemy scatter instead of shooting back.

Turns out we associate the sound with any old-school dive-bombers because of Hollywood.

656,"AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!","Hi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!

Pancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.

We studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.

Our study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755

A commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710

For less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).

Our work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.

--------------
**Edit:** So far in this thread, we have two points being made on the usefullness of the masks: 

1. They prevent hand to mouth/nose touching. 

2. They prevent saliva, mucus/phlegm projection into someone's face, as well as receiving some from the projection of others in close quarters.

Sounds good to me. 

So yes, they are useful, but not as a definitive deterent for airborn disease.

* Other types of masks and filters may be used for air transmitted bacteria and viruses.

- No one that I could notice here has put forward any data on international reported flu/cold rates to draw a rough comparrison between Japan and the world.

I was outside for all of twenty minutes as tightly and hotly bundled as a human can be and my eyelashes froze and I thought I'd freeze solid if I had to stay outside for an hour. I could hardly see where I was going while I was walking into the wind I had to keep blinking and wiping the ice away.

All the while I saw dozen of birds out flying around, in the few patches of river that hadn't frozen yet and flying in the air above. It was -20 give or take when I went out, and that's peanuts compared to what it was overnight, but these birds clearly survived that. How do they manage it?

730,Why can't I weigh the earth by putting a scale upside-down?,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE ANSWERING

This is a theoretical question about gravity not just a stupid question to be funny. Gravity pulls two objects with mass together. The force of gravity is equal to a mass of the object multiplied by an acceleration of a body (in this case, the acceleration of gravity). Both earth and the scale experience the same gravity acceleration because they are both on earth. The force of the scale on the earth should be it's mass multiplied by the acceleration. Conversely, the force the earth exerts on the scale should be it's mass multiplied by gravity acceleration. 

But Newtons second law states there are equal and opposite forces so the force the scale exerts on the earth should be equal to the force exerted by the earth on the scale. It seems that this case is true because the scale doesn't rocket off into space when you turn it upside down but stays in place. 

So is force really mass x acceleration? Where is this discontinuity coming from?

759,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Matthias Hebrok, and my lab has just published a breakthrough in making insulin-producing cells in a dish. My team at UCSF hopes to one day cure type 1 diabetes with transplantable beta cells made from human stem cells. AMA!","I'm a stem cell biologist and director of the UCSF Diabetes Center. My lab aims to generate unlimited supplies of insulin-producing cells to unravel the mysteries of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of combating and defeating the disease. We just published a paper demonstrating for the first time the successful creation of mature, functional insulin-producing cells made from stem cells. Read more here: http://tiny.ucsf.edu/7uNbjg

My lab focuses on type 1 diabetes (T1D), which is the result of an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Currently the only cure for T1D is a pancreas transplant or beta cell transplant, but these options are only available to the sickest patients, who then have to take immunosuppressants for the rest of their lives.

One of the biggest problems in diabetes research is that it is really hard to study these beta cells. They sit in the pancreas, an organ tucked away in the back of our bodies, that is hard to access in living people. We can obtain beta cells from cadaveric donors, but often the process of isolation affects the functionality of the cells. Therefore, one can argue that there is still a lot we do not understand about human beta cells, how they function under normal conditions, how they deteriorate in diabetes, and how one can possibly fix them. 

By producing working beta cells in the lab, we've opened new doors to studying diabetes as well as new options for transplant therapies. Down the line, we hope to use genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR to produce transplantable cells that don't require lifelong immune suppression.


I'm really excited about this work and looking forward to your questions. I'll be starting at 9am PST (12 ET, 16 UT). AMA!

Ask us anything!","Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to doctors. It spreads through the air. Particles of virus can float for up to 2 hours after an infected person passes through a room. People are contagious for 4 days before they have a rash and about 4 days after they get the rash. Because it's so easy to catch, about 95% of a population has to be vaccinated against the measles to stop it from spreading. In 2017, the latest year for which data are available, only 91.5% of toddlers in the U.S. were vaccinated, according to the CDC.  The number of cases of measles reported during 2019 is the largest number since 1992.  The effectiveness of one dose of measles vaccine is about 93% while after the two recommended doses it is 97%.

804,Do mosquitos hide in predictable locations?,"I've noticed that if there's a mosquito in the room, and I swat at it but fail to kill it, it usually seems to disappear for about 30 minutes before it tries to come after me again.

I'm curious how programmed or predictable mosquito behaviors are. For example, does it actually have a behavior like ""if swatted at, lay low for 30 minutes before trying again?"" Or am I just imagining the correlation? Second, if they do have a ""hide"" behavior, do they choose predictable locations? Do they prefer corners of the room? Areas with less light (do they even use light in making their decisions)? Do they go low to the ground? High on the ceiling? Do they use air currents and calmness to choose a spot?

It seems like I usually find mosquitos hiding out in a shadowy corner near the floor of the room, which is infuriating because if it would just hang out in the open against the white, well-lit wall, it would be a lot easier to hunt them down. This correlation could definitely just be my own confirmation bias at play, though, so I'm curious if much is known on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you for the lovely replies so far! I just wanted to clarify that I'm not actually that interested in \*where\* mosquitos hide in a descriptive sense, I'm more interested in how and ""why"" they make their decisions... like which senses do they use most (vision, smell, touch), and do they actually have different phases like hunting vs. hiding, or are they just sort of always doing the same thing and flying around aimlessly until they detect prey, then go for an attack?

EDIT 2: Well this post blew up! You may notice that it's a bit of a comment graveyard... sorry but askscience has strict commenting policies and the mods had to remove most of the replies. The vast majority of replies were either 1) personal tips for hunting mosquitoes, or 2) personal anecdotes on where mosquitoes hide. 

Precisely one comment linked to an actual scientific research article (thank you /u/Hillsbottom!) showing that at the very least mosquitoes can learn to associate being swatted at with certain chemical odors, and then avoid the source of those odors (people) in the future.

I didn't feel satisfied so I spent a few hours trawling the literature... turns out there's simply no research on this topic! We know a great deal about mosquito hunting behavior and how it finds its target, but seemingly nothing on hiding behavior. It's not even clear whether there exists a ""hiding"" behavioral program, or if they're just sort of always on the hunt and are just updating their attraction/aversion biases in response to swats, etc. 

However, after reading up on it I do think it's safe to say that the majority of the hunting/hiding behaviors are instinctual and not learned. It turns out adult mosquitoes are only alive and hunting for \~2-4 days before they stop and spend several days digesting + laying eggs (they typically repeat this hunt/rest cycle \~3-4 times before they die). Furthermore, a mosquito can collect all the blood it needs in one meal if left undisturbed, so in reality it typically only feeds on 1-5 people before stopping. Therefore, even though to us it seems like mosquitoes are constantly present and attacking us, from a single mosquito's perspective it may only ever encounter a few humans (less than 10) in its life cycle, and over the course of only a few days. That isn't a lot of data for the mosquito to ""learn"" with. So, if the possible answers to my original question are 1) it's random, 2) they have instinct-driven preferences for hiding, with a lot of variation between regions/species, or 3) they learn where to hide from experience, we can probably rule out #3.

* It's not a major issue for putting out the initial fire. Water can still be used. A spray of individual droplets doesn't provide a conductive path.

* It *is* a concern for cutting people out of a crashed vehicle. Responders must be careful not to cut through energised high voltage wiring. But non-electric cars also have hazards to cutting such as airbags.

* It's a concern for removing and storing the wreck. Li-ion batteries can reignite after seemingly being extinguished and this can go on for days.

829,"This is not a 'cicada year,' but I hear one buzzing outside right now. Is there a small set of cicadas out of sync with the main population, or do a few mistakenly mature early every year? Or is this a different species entirely?","There are 'cicada years' every 13 and 17 years in the eastern US, where cicadas emerge by the fucktillions and take over everything. 

But there are a few cicadas every year. I find them and their molted shells all over my yard, and I hear them buzzing away. What are *these* cicadas? The ones that pop up even when it's not a 'cicada year'. 

Are they the same species as either the 13 or 17 year cicada, but a year out of sync? Are they late comers or early bloomers whose development cycle missed a year and caused them to miss the party, and so they pop up without anyone else around to mate with? Or is there a stable population of these cicadas each year that have drifted out of sync thousands of years ago - if so, will they diverge into a separate species after enough time? It seems like this would be a remarkable sort of allopatric speciation that's happening- instead of the population being divided by a river, they get separated by a year in their life cycle. Or is that crazy because their life cycle is very rigidly 13/17 years and there's just no way in hell they're deviate from that?

Thanks for all your questions. Find images, videos, and everything you need to know about our historic mission to unfold the universe: [jwst.nasa.gov](http://jwst.nasa.gov).**

-----

The James Webb Space Telescope (aka Webb) is the most complex, powerful and largest space telescope ever built, designed to fold up in its rocket before unfolding in space. After its scheduled Dec. 24, 2021, liftoff from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana (located in South America), Webb will embark on a 29-day journey to an orbit one million miles from Earth.

For two weeks, it will systematically deploy its sensitive instruments, heat shield, and iconic primary mirror. Hundreds of moving parts have to work perfectly - there are no second chances. Once the space telescope is ready for operations six months after launch, it will unfold the universe like we've never seen it before. With its infrared vision, JWST will be able to study the first stars, early galaxies, and even the atmospheres of planets outside of our own solar system. Thousands of people around the world have dedicated their careers to this endeavor, and some of us are here to answer your questions. We are:

+ Dr. Jane Rigby, NASA astrophysicist and Webb Operations Project Scientist (JR)
+ Dr. Alexandra Lockwood, Space Telescope Science Institute project scientist and Webb communications lead (AL)
+ Dr. Stephan Birkmann, European Space Agency scientist for Webb's NIRSpec camera (SB)
+ Karl Saad, Canadian Space Agency project manager (KS)
+ Dr. Sarah Lipscy, Ball Aerospace deputy director of New Business, Civil Space (SL)
+ Mei Li Hey, Northrop Grumman mechanical design engineer (MLH)
+ Shawn Domagal-Goldman, NASA branch head for the Planetary Systems Laboratory (SDG)

AMA!","Hi Reddit! I’m [Brian Hare](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/people/brian-hare), and I’m here to talk about canine cognition and how ordinary and extraordinary dog behaviors reveal the role of cognition in the rich mental lives of dogs. The scientific community has made huge strides in our understanding of dogs’ cognitive abilities – I’m excited to share some of the latest and most fascinating – and sometimes surprising – discoveries with you. Did you know, for example, that some dogs can  learn words like human infants? Or some dogs can detect cancer? What makes dogs so successful at winning our hearts?
 
A bit more about me: I’m an associate professor at Duke University where I founded and direct the [Duke Canine Cognition Center](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/research/dogs), which is the first center in the U.S. dedicated to studying how dogs think and feel. Our work is being used to improve training techniques, inform ideas about canine cognitive health and identify the best service and bomb detecting dogs.  I helped reveal the love and bond mechanism between humans and dogs. Based on this research, I co-founded [Dognition](https://www.dognition.com), an online tool featuring fun, science-based games that anyone with a dog can use to better understand how their dog thinks compared to other dogs. 
 
Let’s talk about the amazing things dogs can do and why – Ask Me Anything!

912,Does gravity have a range or speed?,"So, light is a photon, and it gets emitted by something (like a star) and it travels at ~300,000 km/sec in a vacuum. I can understand this. Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

I realize that it's entirely possible that my concept of gravity is way off so please correct me if that's the case. This is something that's always interested me but I could never wrap my head around.

Imagine you are walking to the bus stop. Your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. Before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, I think you get the picture. If you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it?

If you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example.

I'm Kaeli Swift a behavioral ecologist specializing in crows and other corvids at the University of Washington.  Right now my work focuses on the foraging ecology of the *cutest* corvid, the Canda jay.  For the previous six years though, I studied the funeral behaviors of American crows. These studies involved trying to understand the adaptive motivations for why crows alarm call and gather near the bodies of deceased crows through both field techniques and non-lethal brain imaging techniques.  Along the way, I found some pretty surprising things out about how and when crows touch dead crows.  Let's just say sometimes they really put the crow in necrophilia!

I'm an emergency manager, doing disaster and emergency response for the past 25 years; I've worked at the local and state level, and served in FEMA for eight years as a Deputy Administrator. I've been a firefighter and EMT, and I know first-hand the importance of having the equipment and supplies you need, when you need it on the front lines of a crisis. Right now, I work with teams across the government - from the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human Services - to ensure our country has the supplies we need, not just now but into the future too.

We will be joining you all at 5 PM ET (22 UT), AUA!

1006,Why my phones touchscreen sometimes registers a touch when in reality my finger is millemeter or two from screen?,"My guess is static electricity since it only happens once in a while and randomly but i am hoping for more insightful explanation.

Edit:
It also usually happens in the middle of typing. It never happened, for me, on first letters I typed. And, I am sure my finger did not touch the screen in a way i just did not feel it. When it happened i was surely away from screen, that is why it always jumps out when it happens. It is always unexpected.

Edit2:
I can surely replicate phone registering very soft touches (without me feeling actually touching it) but those random ones I am experiencing are different, the finger is always a lot further away than when i can register a touch without feeling it by testing. A lot may be very relative term but that is how it feels to me, i am not really sure how far the finger actually is because it usually happens really fast and its hard to measure so small distances with feelings. So, there is a small chance that i am imagining it.

I am also the co-founder of the [World Science Festival](https://www.worldsciencefestival.com/), an organization that creates novel, multimedia experience to bring science to general audiences.

My scientific research focuses on the search for Einstein's dream of a unified theory, which for decades has inspired me to work on string theory. For much of that time I have helped develop the possibility that the universe may have more than three dimensions of space. 

I'm also an author, having written four books for adults, *The Elegant Universe*, *The Fabric of the Cosmos*, *The Hidden Reality*, and just recently, *Until the End of Time*. *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)* and *[The Fabric of the Cosmos](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)* were both adapted into NOVA PBS mini-series, which I hosted, and a short story I wrote, *Icarus at the End of Time*, was adapted into a live performance with an original score by Philip Glass. Last May, my work for the stage *[Light Falls](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-fabric-of-the-cosmos/)*, which explores Einstein's discovery of the General Theory, was broadcast nationally on PBS.

These days, in addition to physics research, I'm working on a television adaptation of Until the End of Time as well as various science programs that the World Science Festival is producing.

I'm originally from New York and went to Stuyvesant High School, then studied physics at Harvard, graduating in 1984. After earning my doctorate at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in 1987, I moved to Harvard as a postdoc, and then to Cornell as a junior faculty member. I have been professor mathematics and physics at Columbia University since 1996.

My latest book, ""Digital Cash: The Unknown History of the Anarchists, Technologists, and Utopians Who Created Cryptocurrency,"" tells the story of the events, causes, and communities that led to the development of the contemporary crypto landscape. It dives into numerous utopian and radical subcultures, from cryptoanarchists, cypherpunks, and gold-standard libertarians to Extropians and transhumanists, all of whom - as it turned out - were tied into the project of trying to invent computational money. 

I was recently featured as one of the experts in NOVA's documentary film, ""Crypto Decoded"", about the history behind cryptography and cryptocurrency. You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnavKPl5f9I

 Ask me anything about:

+ What does crypto teach us about what money is?
+ Will crypto change how we think about money?
+ Where else is cryptography used?
+ How did cryptocurrency begin?
+ Are cryptocurrencies hacker-proof?
+ What problems has cryptography solved?

1027,What is the theoretical limit to a helicopters speed?,"I have been wondering lately what the theoretical top speed of a helicopter would be. I have a basic understanding of retreating blade stalls and keep seeing it listed as one of the main limitations to a helicopters top speed, along with the advancing blade eventually breaking the speed of sound creating shockwaves and the more obvious ones like drag.

In theory if we imagine we have a helicopter with an infinitely powerful engine and made of materials that would never be damaged from heat or the forces caused by flying at high speeds, would these limits still apply? If it is a coaxial helicopter then the retreating blade stall shouldn't be a problem as it would be stalling on opposite sides at the same time and if the rotors are made of this theoretical material the shockwaves wouldn't damage them.

1039,Do surgeons train to perform skills with both hands?,"I was painting my linen closet on the weekend (stay with me here this is relevant I promise) and there was a really awkward area behind the door jam that I had to bend weirdly to paint with my dominant hand. The other side of the closet had the same geometry and it was impossible to paint that spot with my dominant hand so I had a crack with my non dominant and did a half decent job. (there were shelves built into the closet so it was impossible to step inside to be in a better position.) 

For a summer job I cleaned windows on high rises (look up rope access if you're interested) and from the outset my boss trained me to practice cleaning with both hands while learning so I could cover more area at once.

*tldr questions start here:*
Anyway, this got me thinking, when a surgeon is digging through a body cavity, are there any awkward spots? Do you ever find that you can't reach from a particular angle and the other hand reaches better? Is this really bad practice? Do you just reposition your paitient? Are there more reachy tools that do the trick? Ever been forced to abandon a procedure because you've realised you've come from the wrong angle? Are there any skills that you by default train yourself to do ambidextrous because it'll come in handy? Or is this never an issue?

1066,"Since one of the X chromosomes in every female sex cell is inactivated, why aren't all heterozygous females ""Tortoiseshell"" haired.","This is probably a very stupid question but Google does not seem to help at all and it's been bugging me for the last 2 hours. 

The title is a very shortened and simplified version of my question, so let me explain it in more detail.

For example, a (obviously homozygous) blonde man and a homozygous dark haired woman had a female child. The daughter would be (again obviously) heterozygous, hair color-wise, meaning she has one allele coding light hair from her father and another one coding dark hair from her mother. By the laws of (probably highly simplified) genetics, the daughter would have inhairited dark hair, as the dark hair allele is the dominant one in her genotype. However, as I understand, to make sure both famale and male organisms have roughly the same level of gene expression in both sexes, RANDOM one of the X chromosomes in female organisms gets inactivated. Now back to the whole cat fiasco. I was reading about tortoiseshell cats and everything made perfect sense to me. Since one of the cat's X chromosome located alleles codes for orange hair, and another variation of it codes for black, AND  one gets inactivated with basically a 50/50 chance, the cats fur presents as a black-orange mosaic depending on the pigment amount/pigment variation coded in a specific cell. Back to our heterozygous daughter. Why isn't her hair a blonde-black mosaic? If the chromosome inactivated was inharited from her mother, the strand should be blonde and vice versa.
Now, I do have some theories about why that doesn't happen. For once, this overly simplified model of hair color inharitance is basically high school level genetics, so I'm sure someone's true hair color is determined by a variation of many genes. 
Another explenation would be the hair color genes only being situated on the 23rd pair in cats. 
Unfortunately, this just raised more questions in me. It can't only be cats then, right? Does any other mammal have this fur variation or something analogical? It also can't possibly only affect hair color, surely there are other alleles on the sex chromosomes that would fit into this weird expression loophole. 
While answering, try not to be to rough. I'm only just out of high school and about to re-take my finals. I'm very passionate about biology and so interested in genetics, but sometimes I just don't completely understand.

I’ve been trying to understand different evidences of common ancestry, and one topic that had been brought up was the discovery of endogenous retroviruses and their presence in the human genome and other animals, which points to a common ancestor.

To clarify, my question is how do we know the retroviruses found in our DNA and the DNA of other species are from a virus infecting a common ancestor, and not a result of a prevalent virus in the past that infected multiple species around the same time, resulting in an alteration of the genomes of different species but occurring around the same time? If that makes sense.

I don’t necessarily believe that, but growing up in a very conservative, 6-day creationist, Christian household, I think that it’s a thought that could pop up in response to the ERV findings, so I am interested in what the rebuttal would be. I am not knowledgeable at all in these areas, and so I’m grateful to anyone who can help me understand and learn this in a simpler way, if possible. Thanks!

I understand why smuggling gold OUT of the country could be harmful, but what economic harm could come from smuggling gold IN?

This system will be used to feed the astronauts at every step of the mission.  You'll see us listed on their website as the Arrakis Terrarium Project, as we recently rebranded: https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/teams

Our solution centers around enclosed ecosystems!  Think of a 4 foot by 4 foot by 26 inch (1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.66 meters) climate-controlled community garden plot in a box, complete with a water cycle, lights, temperature control, humidity control, sensor data, and more.  The internals are separate from the externals, meaning that the plants have an ideal environment despite what's going on outside.  We have proof of concept, and if you would like to see our prototype, some of our harvest, and our work, feel free to check out our website: https://autoterraproject.co/

We would also like to someday use our devices to strengthen food security on Earth by partnering with nonprofits to put these into the homes of people in need.  The devices require 0 daily maintenance and allow the users to access fresh foods whenever needed, without having to worry about supply lines, costs in grocery stores, or transportation.

If you'd like to support us, the biggest thing you can do is to get on our website and sign up to our email list!  It'll help us show others that our project is important and aid us in getting additional funding to continue our work.

The people answering questions from our team include:

+ **Ariel Shramko** (/u/ATPSpaceFood) the environmental engineer on the team.  They create the criteria for the ecosystem, create the ecosystem itself, monitor the health of the units, and complete some of the chemical engineering within the project as well.
+ **Eliot Pirone** (/u/Necessary_Ad_126) the mechanical engineer behind the physical design of the project.  If Ariel determines what the units need to do to maintain healthy environments for the plants and changes the living matter within the ecosystems, Eliot figures out how to make that happen.

1229,"How exactly is the ""direction"" of the flow of power measured in a alternating current system?","(Quick info to start with, I'm from Germany, so I may make some mistakes with the technical vocabulary and some best practices may differ)


So this is a kinda awkward question for me to ask, considering I'm an electrical engineer planning the electrical systems for all kind of construction projects, and I like to think I'm quite good at it, including the technical side.


But during a conversation with a colleague yesterday, we noticed we both can't quite explain how exactly the drection of the flow of power is measured in AC power systems (compared to DC, where it's really easy). We both know it's possible, we both have watched old electricity meters (like [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Drehstromzaehler_offen.jpg)) run backwards when either wired incorrectly or when the measured system is actually feeding power into the mains, for example with solar panels. And while I understand the basic principles of those old meters (it's essentially a finely tuned linear induction motor), what I can't figure out is how the **direction** of the powerflow is determined. Even worse with modern electronic meters, those don't even have moving parts where I could at least justify that they work the same as the old ones. And yet those to can determine the direction and don't measure currents running in the opposite direction (for example again with solar panels when you don't actually have a contact for receive compensation for the power you provide. The meter simply doesn't count up or down when you produce more than you need and thus are feeding into the mains. Mechanical meters solved this with a ratchet system.)

AC power doesn't have an inherent direction, that's its fundamental principle. So how do those meters do it? The only thing I can come up with is that it's basically more like ""measuring"" the voltage differential between one side and the other, or at least that that is what determines the direction. But *how*? What physical effects are used to electronically measure if power is flowing from A to B and when it's going from B to A?

However, whenever there is an infection in the body, it always seems like the closest lymph nodes are the ones active, eg. under the jaw during a cold, or under the armpit after a vaccine. Wouldn’t there be just as much chance that the B cell able to identify your sore throat antigens lives in a lymph node further from the site of infection like the groin, ect.?

You can learn more about these efforts in the recent PBS Nature documentary ""[American Ocelot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiQ8zOlWHUQ&t),"" now available to stream in the US.

I'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (18 UT). Ask me anything!

1291,AskScience AMA Series: We're Experts on Influenza (aka the Flu). AUA!,"It's flu season in the Northern hemisphere, so we're here to answer any questions you have about the flu!

Every year, [more than 300,000 people worldwide die from complications related to seasonal influenza](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/burden-of-disease). Even though the yearly flu shot [reduces infections, decreases hospitalizations and prevents thousands of deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm), there is clearly more work to be done. Further complicating things is that many of the typical symptoms of flu overlap with symptoms of COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and the common cold.

Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about seasonal and pandemic influenza. We'll answer your questions about why we need a different flu shot every year, talk about the process of identifying, making and delivering the flu vaccine, and discuss strategies for minimizing (and hopefully preventing) the spread of influenza. Ask us anything!

Assuming you can control the frequency (and hence the energy) of the photon, you can theoretically send a photon of any arbitrary energy towards the atom. Let's say that the energy required to excite the electron from the 1s state to 2s is 1. (Some arbitrary units) And the energy to from 2s to 2p is 0.5 in the same units. Now if I fire a photon of 1.4 energy units, where does the extra 0.4 energy go? There's no further sub quanta of energy it can excite the electron to. Does that mean that such a photon will never be absorbed by the atom? Is there some non quantized sink of energy it can go to, like the kinetic energy of the atom or something like that?",Physics,2022-11-16 04:09:46,Least_Ad104,10,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ywrona/if_energy_levels_in_quantum_systems_are_quantized/

Water is less dense as a solid so pressure causes it to melt, so I'm not thinking there could be a solid core by pressure.  I'm wondering, if there was a drop of water 14 miles across (so the center is as far from the surface s the Challenger Deep), what would the pressure be at the center? Could we scuba all the way through?

Maybe it would help to imagine a spherical ""drop"" of water of radius (depth) x, in free fall, with enough of a ""balloon"" around it to prevent heat loss and evaporation but not add and ""squeeze pressure.""

From my understanding, with not as much research, neurogenesis isn't going to replace damaged cells, but it will help functionally promote more cells of the damage brain in places like the hippocampus and the amygdala. Neuroplasticity is when the brain rewires where the damaged brain function is to another part of the brain to get it to work properly.

If so, how would this work?","I guess ""mindreading"" would the the broad term for this, but I'm talking more like being able to record what someone is thinking and hearing when they are dreaming, hallucinating, or asked to imagine the image of a frog, for example. I know next to nothing about neurology, so this is probably way off, but I imagine that we'd have to first scan a person's brain so we can see what electrical impulses are occurring and where, and then we'd have to understand the function of each individual neuron or whatever, and then be able to interpret patterns from whatever the current combination of electric signals are in said person brain. Then we'd have to convert that analog information to a digital visual and auditory representation that can be displayed on a screen. But I suppose one of the biggest problems is that everyone's brain is different, so even if you could interpret one person's brain, it wouldn't work on another. You'd have to have some kind of AI that could dynamically analyze the pattern of any given person's brain and understand how it functions.

Again this is just my uninformed, speculative rambling. I'm interested to hear from more knowledgeable people how this could actually work though. The benefits of such a technology are truly mindblowing. Imagine the creative potential for art, music, fictional writing, movies, etc., if we were able to do this? Imagine being able to actually see and hear what a person experienced during a sleep paralysis episode! True horror movie potential right there.

The prenatal testosterone lead to the development of the male reproductive system from the Wolffian duct while AMH leads to the disintegration of the Mullerian duct. Conversely, if there is no Y chromosome and no upsurge of testosterone or presence of AMH, the Wolffian duct disintegrates while the Mullerian duct develops into the female reproductive tract.

In that case, it seems like people with XO genotypes have no Y chromosome = no TDF = no AMH/high levels of T, so they should develop ovaries. What am I missing?

In the thought experiment about Schrödinger's Cat, why is it that we are allowed to assume that the cat is both dead and alive?

1396,"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Kareem El-Badry, astrophysicist and black hole hunter. My team just discovered the nearest known black hole. AMA!","I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I use a mix of telescope observations, stellar evolution models, and Milky Way surveys to study binary stars -- that is, pairs of stars that are orbiting each other and (in most cases) formed from the same gas cloud. My collaborators and I recently published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06833) reporting the discovery of a binary containing a dormant black hole and a Sun-like star, orbiting each other at roughly the same distance as the Earth and the Sun. The black hole is about 10 times the mass of the Sun, so its event horizon is about 30 km. At a distance of about 1600 light years from Earth, it's about 3 times closer than the next-closest known black hole.

The black hole is fairly different from other stellar-mass black holes we know about, which are almost all bright X-ray and radio sources. They're bright because they're feeding on a companion star, and gas from the star forms a disk around the black hole where it gets heated to millions of degrees. That's how we discover those black holes in the first place. But in this one -- which we named Gaia BH1 -- the companion star is far enough away that the black hole isn't getting anything to eat, and so it's not bright in X-rays or radio. The only reason we know it's there at all is that we can see the effects of its gravity on the Sun-like star, which is orbiting an invisible object at a 100 km/s clip.

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/05/science/astronomy-black-hole.html) a NYT article with more info about the discovery, and [here's](https://www.mpia.de/news/science/2022-16-gaia-bh1) a press release that goes into somewhat more detail.

How does the location and amount of water in Earth's water bodies change over time, particularly in a warming climate? The upcoming [SWOT](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/overview/) (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission plans to find out.

The SUV-size satellite will measure the height of Earth's salt and fresh water around the world, [track regional shifts in sea level](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/66/international-satellite-to-track-impacts-of-small-ocean-currents/) at scales never seen before, and make NASA's first truly [global survey of the planet's fresh water](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/news/68/us-european-satellite-will-make-worlds-first-global-freshwater-survey/).

By tracking water around the world, SWOT will help us manage water resources and make decisions in communities affected by sea level rise and climate change.

SWOT is scheduled for launch in December. It is a collaboration between NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES), with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the UK Space Agency.

We are:

+ **Eva Peral (EP)**, Systems Engineer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Margaret Srinivasan (MS)**, SWOT Applications Lead, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Cedric David (CD)**, Hydrologist, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
+ **Ben Hamlington (BH)**, Oceanographer, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Ask us anything, including:

+ How SWOT can help communities manage water resources
+ What SWOT can tell us about the ocean's role in climate change
+ The engineering behind SWOT's main instrument, the Ka-band Radar Interferometer (KaRIn)
+ How SWOT will monitor fresh water sources like lakes, rivers, and reservoirs

1460,"Can trained professionals examine human remains and reliably tell whether the person was primarily European, African, Asian, Native American, etc? If we ignore the outermost superficial layer, are there any forensically measurable differences between people of different races or populations?","I've been having this discussion with a friend, and realized that I needed to do more investigation. I referenced a 60 Minutes episode (from a few years ago) where a scientist was able to determine if somebody was white or black just by looking at accelerometer data from when they would jump on and off of a sensor. This was independent of age, sex, or body size, implying some underlying difference in musculature and nerve reaction.

My friend countered with [this article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-general-science/are-you-there-race-its-me-dna), which calls into question whether or not race is a relevant term, and which points out that genetic diversity between we humans is really quite small.

1468,"Is this a geometrical rationale for the ""360 degrees to a circle"" convention? (or a coincidence?)","Playing some kids’ geometric puzzle pieces (and then doing some pencil & paper checks), I realized something.

It started like this: I can line up a sequence of pentagons and equilateral triangles, end-to-end, and get a cycle (a segmented circle). There are 30 shapes in this cycle (15 pentagon-triangle pairs), and so the perimeter of the cycle is divided then into 30 equal straight segments.

[Here is a figure to show what i'm talking about] (https://imgur.com/NfXtoDK)

You can do something similar with squares and triangles and you get a smaller cycle: 6 square-pentagon pairs, dividing the perimeter into 12 segments.

And then you can just build it with triangles - basically you just get a hexagon with six sides.

For regular polygons beyond the pentagon, it changes. Hexagons and triangles gets you a straight line (actually, you *can* get a cycle out of these, but it isn't of segments like all the others). Then, you get cycles bending in the opposite direction with 8-, 9-, 12-, 15-, and 24-gons. For those, respectively, the perimeter (now the ‘inner’ boundary of the pattern - see the figure above for an example) is divided into 24, 18, 12, 10, and 8 segments.

You can also make cycles with some polygons on their own: triangles, squares, hexagons (three hexagons in sequence make a cycle), and you can do it a couple of ways with octagons (with four or eight). You can also make cycles with some other combinations (e.g. 10(*edited from 5*) pentagon-square pairs).

Here’s what I realized:
The least common multiple of those numbers (the number of segments to the perimeter of the triangle-polygon circle) is *360*! (at least, I’m pretty sure of it.. maybe here I have made a mistake).

This means that if you lay all those cycles on a common circle, and if you want to subdivide the circle in such a way as to catch the edges of every segment, you need 360 subdivisions.

Am I just doing some kind of circular-reasoning numerology here or is this maybe a part of the long-lost rationale for the division of the circle into 360 degrees? The wikipedia article claims it’s not known for certain but seems weighted for a “it’s close to the # of days in the year” explanation, and also nods to the fact that 360 is such a *convenient* number (can be divided lots and lots of ways - which seems related to what I noticed). Surely I am not the first discoverer of this pattern.. in fact this seems like something that would have been easy for an ancient Mesopotamian to discover..

*
*
*edit for tldr*
*
*

For those who don't understand the explanation above (i sympathize): to be clear, this method gets you exactly 360 subdivisions of a circle *but it has nothing to do with choice of units*. *It's a coincidence*, not a tautology, as some people are suggesting.. I thought it was an interesting coincidence because the method relies on constructing circles (or cycles) out of elementary geometrical objects (regular polyhedra).


The most common response below is basically what wikipedia says (i.e. common knowledge); 360 is a highly composite number, divisible by the Babylonian 60, and is close to the number of days in the year, so that probably is why the number was originally chosen. But I already recognized these points in my original post.. what I want to know is whether or not this **coincidence** has been noted before or proposed as a possible method for how the B's came up with ""360"", *even if it's probably not true*.

I am trying to establish **whether a paramagnetic salt** (manganese II chloride) **maintains its paramagnetism when dissolved in a polar, aqueous solution** (at which point, it is assumed that it would dissociate into its constituent ions). In a moment of redneck engineering, we placed a small bar magnet on the side of the manganese II chloride saturated solution, to see whether the ions would re-orient themselves in response to this applied field. **No change was observed in response to this applied field.**

I have a few questions that I'm stumped on:

**1. Does the fraction of lone pair electrons in a paramagnetic substance change dependent on the strength of an applied magnetic field?**

**2. Does the speed at which the electrons relocalize change in response to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field?** (ie. maybe we just didn't wait long enough to observe the change)

yDNA Haplogroup G seems to have originated around the Caucasus region (where the highest diversity and rates of G are found today).

It is also home to the kartvelian language family, seemingly a final bastion from the spread of indo European and Turkic languages. A language family not known to be directly connected to any others, but influenced by indo European.


Since the spread of yDNA G, especially G2a is associated with the spread of farming in Europe and west Asia, it stands to reason that the kartvelian languages could be an offshoot descendant of a larger, older early farmer language family. Possibly similar enough to what the early European farmers would have spoken.

There have also been reports that they alter our gut biome in harmful ways.  For example this quote ( [Artificial Sweeteners Alter Gut Bacteria in Humans | The Scientist Magazine® (the-scientist.com)](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/artificial-sweeteners-alter-gut-bacteria-in-humans-70395) ):

"" Now, working in the lab of Weizmann Institute of Science immunologist Eran Elinav, Suez and colleagues have taken an array of common artificial sweeteners—saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia—and filled that gap in the literature by testing them in humans. Their findings, described today (August 19) in [*Cell*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.07.016), suggest these sweeteners do indeed alter the gut microbiome, as was seen in prior mouse work. This, the researchers say, adversely impacts glucose tolerance, a measure of how readily the body moves sugar from the blood into muscle and fat, possibly leading to weight gain and diabetes. ""

My question is, are ""natural"" sweeteners such as those based on Monk Fruit (which gets its sweetness from a compound called, ""mogroside V"" and is often mixed with erythritol) chemically similar to artificial sweeteners and do they carry the same health risks?

> Scientists at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching have opened up a new chapter in optics: in experiments with gamma rays at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble they have proven that these extremely high-energy electromagnetic waves can be focused by lenses like conventional light — the researchers have thus refuted a fundamental assumption of theoretical physics that had been valid for decades. Their discovery will make a great many new applications possible in medicine and materials research, for example.  
> Optical instruments like telescopes and microscopes are based on the refraction of light: in a medium such as glass the electromagnetic waves propagate more slowly than in air or in a vacuum, and are therefore diffracted — for example, onto the focal plane of a photo camera. The refractive index, which depends on the lens material and the frequency of the waves, describes how large this effect is: the more it deviates from 1, the stronger the diffraction of the light beams.  
> Until now, physicists had assumed that electromagnetic radiation with far greater energy than that in the visible spectrum could not be diffracted with lenses. They had calculated that the refractive index in this region of the spectrum is almost precisely 1 for all materials. **However, back in the mid-1990s it turned out that X-rays are also diffracted by beryllium or carbon lenses, and thus that X-ray optics were possible.**  
> When Dietrich Habs, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich and Fellow of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, and his team were making their measurements at the ILL they discovered that this also applies to the even higher energy gamma-rays — after X-ray optics, the era of gamma optics is now beginning.

Where x is streamwise, y is spanwise, and z is wall-normal. According to my professor, the centripetal acceleration from curvature balances out the pressure gradient, dP/dx=v^(2)/r. In the BL, the velocity decreases at the surface, so the radius of curvature must reduce to compensate for this. This leads to tighter curvature. Is it this smaller curvature that allows pressure to bend the streamline flow to spawn crossflow?

Since frequency and energy are connected, it looks like that amount of energy would correspond to approx. 10\^24 Hz, which is unimaginably a lot. The wavelength for this frequency should be on the order of 10\^-16 m.

Going backwards, Planck length to frequency, that's 10\^43 Hz and energy of about 7 GJ, or about 10\^16 TeV. Is this reasoning sound? If so, is that the absolute maximum energy a photon can have?

i know one of the reason is because of considering splicing mutations but it seems there is  another reason for doing that and the 50bp is a safe spot for the primer to make. why is that?",Biology,2022-10-27 12:10:10,vahidah,0,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/yf0hgt/why_should_we_make_primer_between_exon/
1574,why can't a photon of appropriate energy enable P->N conversion?,"i understand that the uud structure of the proton is the lowest allowed energy state of three quarks, and thus it can't decay (supersymmetric theories aside). the neutron, meanwhile, is udd and can (when by itself, or in the right kind of nucleus) undergo beta decay to a proton via spontaneous emission of a massive, charged W boson.

furthermore, i understand that for instance non-spontaneous fission occurs when a neutron of sufficient energy interacts with the nucleus, bringing it to an unstable energy level. u235 is close to this level, and thus fissions when interacting with a neutron of even thermal energy, whereas u238 needs a higher-energy neutron to fission. high-energy photons can furthermore knock nucleons out in photodisintegration.

2.78MeV differentiate the up and down quark. This energy ought be readily available; the excited Ni60 metastate decays with a 1.33MeV γ, about half this value. Why don't we see protons transmuting to neutrons when such gamma rays hit them, especially in e.g. a plasma where there are no electrons to get in the way (at nuclear distance scales)?

At the beginning he talked about that they don't know much about the beginning of the Goths but that they expect that they lived in what now is Poland.

He showed 1 example of such signs, it was a ring of stones (like Stonehenge but way smaller and not stacked) in a forest. The stones were around 0,5m tall and probably artificially rounded on the top.
Afterwards I asked how they know how old those stones are, but he couldn't answer my question.

So that's my question to you. How do they know when those stones were placed there? Because you can't just use the age of the stones, they are way older.

To my current understanding protons, and generally things with opposing charges, repel one another. This alone would cause protons to fly away from one another until nuclear strong force comes in. If I'm not mistaken nuclear strong force is the force between particles in a nucleus that allows them to be bound together, all particles have this property but neutrons to protons is the most important example as it allows a neutron to bind to two protons effectively holding the two together. My subsequent question is then obvious, if particles bind to each other and the neutral force of a neutron means there's no electromagnetic force separating them why don't massive amounts of neutrons accumulate among each other over time creating a mega neutron ball?

I'm assuming that this question also relates to another question of mine that being ""why can't I just bombard unstable isotopes of massive atoms such as oganesson with neutrons until the strong force granted by them eventually overpowers the immense electromagnetic force of all the protons.""

So assume I have a new drug that has the potential to be extremely effective at treating cancer.

At this point, I feel like there's an ethical issue because are we not knowingly taking individuals with a life threatening illness and deliberately giving them a non treatment?

Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is almost constantly low so the horizontal pressure gradient is low. Consequently, the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while **in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.""** Does this mean that in places such as Central America, Hawaii, and the Philippines, which have rainforests that are farther from the equator, (above 10 degrees North latitude) the trees are generally not as tall?

AMA!","I am [Doctor Mark Horowitz](https://markhorowitz.org/) MBBS PhD, and I am a psychiatric researcher in the National Health Service in England, an honorary researcher at University College London and training psychiatrist. My research has been concerned with how to safely stop psychiatric medications based on understanding their effects on the brain - and the technique I have developed, called [hyperbolic tapering](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2215-0366(19)30032-X/fulltext), has been adopted as [guidance](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/treatments-and-wellbeing/stopping-antidepressants) for the public by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK. This research came out of my own awful experience coming off antidepressants. I run a clinic in the public health service in London to help people safely stop psychiatric drugs for anxiety and depression and find that many people who could not stop their medication in the 'old-fashioned' ways are able to do so safely in my clinic, now supported by studies using similar techniques.

I am also a co-author of the recent umbrella review assessing the validity of the serotonin hypothesis ('chemical imbalance') in depression, published in [Molecular Psychiatry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0). While many psychiatrists say this is old news, research suggests that over 80% of the public still believe in the chemical imbalance theory, and many companies and healthcare bodies still promote it on their websites.

In North America, I have co-founded a company called [Outro Health](https://www.outro.health/), which brings this gradual, supported and hyperbolic approach to people in Canada and the US, so that people will have the support they need (and which I did not have!).

1639,How does exit area for a rocket nozzle affect thrust?,"Let me lead off by saying I *am* aware of the equation for this. I'm confused by some of the details. I've been trying to learn a thing or two about rocket engines and I'm struggling to pick apart this particular question.

So in the combustion chamber you've got an initial temperature and pressure (etc.) which are basically a function of the reactants you are using. These determine the area of the throat, which is sized so that you get sonic flow at that choke point. You need the A\* that gives M=1 at the throat.

But I'm confused about what determines the shape and size of the nozzle after that... Here's a few things I do understand:

* The propellant shifts to supersonic after the throat. Velocity increases as the area expands.
* Temperature and pressure drop as velocity increases.
* Ideally, you want the pressure at exit to be equal to ambient pressure. (This is mainly about efficiency?)
* The exact shape (and length?) isn't super important. It's mostly just about weight and cost.

I guess it's that third point is perhaps what has me confused. When I look at the equation for thrust, there's two terms:

1. mass flow rate \* exit velocity
2. exit area \* pressure difference from ambient

Let me assume a fixed mass flow rate. The equation for exit velocity is... basically a function of exit pressure. The other terms are basically all coming directly from your choice of fuel/oxidizer and other initial conditions. The exact term where it appears is `1-Pe/P0` so I think what that's saying is the ""ideal"" is zero exit pressure? The higher your exist pressure is to the initial pressure at combustion, the less energy you've gotten out of it. And lower exit pressure ultimately requires a larger nozzle exist area.

But then if the exit pressure is too low you start to suffer from the second term. Because if exit pressure is lower than ambient this term goes negative.

Am I right in understanding that this is the tricky balance you need to strike? And shooting for Pe=Pa is where it happens to be optimized for thrust?",Engineering,2022-10-20 15:08:31,jofwu,12,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/y9bjct/how_does_exit_area_for_a_rocket_nozzle_affect/

So by using a vaccine that is essentially a cocktail of current and predicted strains, perhaps we could catch up to the virus?

1722,"AskScience AMA Series: We are paleontologists here to talk about Dakota the Dinosaur Mummy, AUA!","Hello /r/AskScience! Dinosaur mummies preserve skin and other soft tissues, but how they fossilize has always been a bit of a quandry. It's generally thought that very rapid burial is required to protect remains from predators, scavengers, and other agents of decomposition. However, they often also appear desiccated, which usually takes long-term exposure on the landscape.

Recent preparation on the Edmontosaurus mummy ""Dakota"" revealed the first evidence of predator activity on dinosaurian soft tissues and provided an alternate explanation for how these rare fossils form. You can read [our recent publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275240) in PLOS One.

I remember reading before that the advent of cooking was an inflection point in our evolution, and that we had evolved some traits (e.g. smaller teeth and jaws) likely in response to the change in diet once our food started to come cooked. It got me thinking: if cooked food placed enough evolutionary pressure for “cost-saving” traits like our less beefy chewing muscles, could it have been enough to push something like better responses to thermal burns in order to minimize losing access to food. Surely the risk of being unable to eat is enough of a driver for some change, and the burning risk that comes from a piece of meat fresh out of the fire would be a new environmental aspect that we hadn’t had to deal with before.

1749,Does genetic testing of embryos impact the child?,"So current genetic testing of IVF embryos is to get the egg and sperm together, make a bunch of embryos, wait a few days to see which ones grow and then to pop them open, scrape out a bunch of cells and then send them to the lab. The lab then tests those cells for any abnormalities (aneuploidy, etc) while the embryos get frozen. Once results are back the cleared embryos can be implanted one at a time until one takes.

So there has been some research on childhood cancer risk of frozen embryos and that seems to be a bit elevated relative to standard - 1.6-1.7 times.

This is still a fairly new process and we don’t know if there are any impacts later in life from freezing, it’s an open question as frozen embryo children hit middle age. Fingers crossed.

My question was on the genetic testing side. If you have an embryo and pop it open and remove a bunch of the very first cells, then the remaining cells step up and still deliver a baby. That is established. What impacts might arise from the cell removal process though? Like if you were going to have 100 cells at that point and are now down to 90 or whatever then would that have any impacts later in life? The remaining cells need to divide more I guess.

1763,The 'Infinite monkey theorem'. Is it true?,"The idea is that in an infinite amount of time, a monkey would type out the complete works of Shakespeare(it could be any book of course). 

I'm having a hard time of believing it to be true. I think I accept the premise  that given an infinite amount of time, anything that can happen, will happen. But I'm not sure if I think that a monkey typing out characters in a way that a book is written in is something that can happen. 

My argument is that because the way a monkey's brains work is not like some kind of randomness-machine, and that means you will not have every possible combination, you will tend to see patterns, even very vague patterns that are so vague and unordered that it will seem like randomness, but isn't really completely random. 

In other words I'm arguing that maybe (and it would be dumb to say that I'm sure of this) the possible character combinations for a monkey is actually limited, and not infinite. Which means even if the time is infinite, you will still not see character combinations outside the limit of what the monkey can write. 

**EDIT: Ok, so people have said to me that it's just a mathematical construct. Which means, it's not true: Monkeys can't write the complete works of Shakespeare in an inifnite amount of time.**

**What is true then is that something like a randomness machine, which is typing keys randomly at a typewriter, would eventually write any book that's ever existed, given enough time. Which is by the way not similar to monkeys at all, so don't tell me monkeys is a good metaphor for understanding this, it would be better to just drop the metaphor and used something that actually applies to a real scenario then.**

Ok, so I understand now, you don't have to tell me how confused I am any longer. I just think using monkeys is quite dumb to explaining something like this because it's so far from how it would have worked in real life, and that is my opinion, and both me and your mummy doesn't give a single shit about your disagreement with my subjective opinion. 

Or if you still think I'm saying something factually wrong here, be my guest to explain what I'm not getting.",Mathematics,2015-02-11 00:15:42,Wackintosj,0,0.48,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vincu/the_infinite_monkey_theorem_is_it_true/

I searched google and pubmed for literally 2 hrs to find the answer to my question, and I can't find any information.

I'm especially curious about mRNA vaccines. They get injected into the muscle, the cells there start translating the mRNA and spike protein gets exposed on the membrane and the immune system mounts an attack when then antigen is recognized and destroys those cells. (yes, the cells that display the spike protein are actually getting gobbled up, for anyone who didn't know)

What I am wondering is - what causes the headache? The interleukins? The inflammation of the muscle in general? What is the exact mechanism through which we get a headache after mRNA vaccination against COVID?

1768,How does autopsy reveal whether the vaccine shot is linked to a suspect death?,"Europe is facing some cases of thrombolytic events happened shortly after AZ jab (22 cases in 3 millions)

Among the observations that scientists have been making, there is that such statistics does not show anomalies as thrombosis happens on an even higher frequency regardless. 

In Italy, two deaths are currently being investigated, and the autopsy did not confirm yet that either blood clots have played a role (a policeman and a soldier died of cardiac arrest days after vaccination though they didn't have known pre-existing conditions) or the vaccine did in other ways, or a third yet unknown condition. 

I am not obviously asking regarding the AZ vaccine specifically, nor the deaths in Europe. But since we expect illnesses and/or deaths to happen even in short time in a sufficiently big population, how would an autopsy *prove* a link with the vaccine? 

If other pre-conditions or visible diseases are found out, the physicians can rule out the vaccine's role. 

But had even (by assumption) the vaccine done the harm, the question is, how would the physicians find out during the autopsy? What sign would in some way demonstrate that? Beyond allergic reaction.

1840,"AskScience AMA Series: We are members of 500 Women Scientists, an organization working to build an all-inclusive and diverse scientific community. Ask Us Anything!","[500 Women Scientists](http://500womenscientists.org/) is a grassroots organization started by four women who met in graduate school at CU Boulder and who maintained friendships and collaborations after jobs and life took them away from Boulder. Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. Over 17,000 women from more than 100 countries have signed in support of 500 Women Scientists, pledging to build an inclusive scientific community dedicated to training a more diverse group of future leaders in science and to use the language of science to bridge divides and enhance global diplomacy.

500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from [small groups, not large crowds](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-successful-movements-have-in-common). Our [Local Pods](https://500womenscientists.org/take-action/#pods) help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where women scientists meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.

With us today are six members of the group. They will be answering questions at different points throughout the day so please be patient with receiving answers.

1. Wendy Bohon (Dr_Wendy) - Hi, I'm Dr. Wendy Bohon! My research focuses on examining how the surface and near surface of the earth changes as the result of earthquakes. I also work on improving public education and perception of science, particularly seismology and earthquake hazards. I'm a woman, a scientist, a mother and a proud member of 500 Women Scientists!

2. Hi, I'm [Kelly Fleming](https://kellylfleming.com/), AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and co-leader of 500 Women Scientists. I firmly believe that for science to serve all of society, it must be accessible to diverse people - including underrepresented minorities, immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA people. Although I don't do research anymore, my Ph.D. is in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, where I studied reactions that help turn plant material into fuels. 

3. Tessa Hill - I am [Tessa Hill](http://hillbiogeochemistry.squarespace.com/), an oceanographer at UC Davis, based at [Bodega Marine Laboratory](http://bml.ucdavis.edu/).  I study impacts of climate change on the ocean, including ocean acidification, which is a chemical change occurring in the ocean due to our carbon dioxide emissions. I am excited to be working with 500 Women Scientists to encourage a diverse, inclusive and thriving scientific community.  You can find me on Twitter (@Tessa_M_Hill) and our lab Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/oceanbiogeochemistry

4. Monica Mugnier (MonicaMugnier) - Hi, I'm Dr. Monica Mugnier. I'm an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My lab studies how African trypanosomes, the parasites that cause African sleeping sickness, hide from our immune systems. You can read about our work in more detail at [www.mugnierlab.org](http://www.mugnierlab.org/). When I am not pondering parasites, I spend a lot of time thinking about how we can make the scientific community a more welcoming place for everyone. 

5. Kathleen Ritterbush - Hi, I'm Dr. Kathleen Ritterbush, Assistant Professor of paleontology at the University of Utah. My students and I study mass extinctions and ecosystem changes of sea animals from the time of the dinosaurs and earlier. I believe science careers should include all kinds of people, engage our communities, and support work-life balance.

6. Hi there, I'm a planetary volcanologist. I study the physics of volcanic processes on the Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars using combinations of satellite data, field work, and laboratory experiments. I'm currently transitioning from a position as a postdoctoral fellow at a public university to one at a federal agency. Because I'm a federal employee, I think it is prudent to remain anonymous but I am happy to answer as many of your questions as I can!

Integrate[1 - x/Sqrt[0.25 - x^2 ], {x, 0, 0.5}]

AMA!","Last April, I was visiting family in Florida when a friend, who works in health care, showed me a memo that she received from the state Department of Health, offering scientific explanation for why gender-affirming care should be denied to children in the state.

I started clicking the links in the memo, and reading what the evidence they were citing actually said. It seemed like they were using those citations in bad faith-that the science actually said something other than what the state said the research says.
And so, I reached out to to the doctors whose work Florida was holding up as rationale for banning transgender medicine for minors. Ten doctors all told me that they didn't know Florida was citing their work - and that Florida is distorting their scientific work to push an anti-transgender (and anti-science) agenda.

Earlier this month, my colleagues at VICE News and I published an investigation of our findings, showing that this is part of a larger pattern of Gov. DeSantis's administration going to extreme ends - including lying to health care providers - to block transgender kids from getting the health care they need and deserve.

Let's say there is an obese person who is very sedentary and eats a diet consisting entirely of highly processed foods.  If this person were to lose weight by reducing the overall amount of food they eat, but eating the same foods and maintaining the same activity level, would this improve their health?

However, there are many features unique to what used to be highly isolated populations. 

For example, the people who historically populated and continue to populate the Himalayas are known to have larger hemoglobin than most other cultural isolates, helping them dissolve and absorb oxygen more efficiently at higher altitudes. 

Furthermore, the peoples of Central Africa have a specialized susceptibility to Sickle-Celled Anaemia, which in turn reduces and in some cases even eliminates their risk of contracting malaria from mosquito vectors. 

Even the Germanic people of Northern Europe are in their own way specialized, having the most lactose tolerant individuals per capita in the world, thanks to their naturally developed capability to produce large quantities of the enzyme lactase. 

These populations standing as examples, I believe it is possible to divide the archaic cultural isolates (prior to today's heavily interconnected society) into human taxonomical subspecies, and I wanted to see the reddit science communities opinion on whether this was viable or not. 

If the mods think this question is best placed in another subreddit please, by all means let me know and I will post it there instead.

1956,Perhaps a new idea of how to use quantum entanglement for communication?,"Measuring particle A's spin will result to particle B's spin to be the opposite when measured, I know that much. However, I once heard from somewhere that if you measure particle A's spin on X-axis, measuring particle B's spin on Y-axis will have the probability of 50/50 for either state, instead of going according the normal wavefunction.

So, what if we had, say, 1000 pairs of entangled particles, moved a great distance apart. At a defined moment, location A would either choose to measure the spin of the particles or not do so. After this, location B would measure the spins on the opposite axis. 

By doing this to many particles, location B should see 50/50 distribution if location A didn't measure their particles, or something else if they did, effectively receiving one bit of information.

Could it be done in this manner, or have I misunderstood something about the spin measurements and wavefunctions?",Physics,2016-06-11 12:54:52,Silanael,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4nmxw6/perhaps_a_new_idea_of_how_to_use_quantum/

1966,Does new evidence point to Geocentrism?,"So, this is going to be my first reddit post, and hopefully you guys and gals can help me out.

The other day I heard a noise coming from my computer, it was the warning alert indicating that someone on the internet was wrong. I therefore engaged in a brief discussion with someone who advocates Geocentrism. Never having been exposed to this seriously outside of history classes about Galileo/Copernicus, and having a computer science background, I didn't feel well equipped to debate this strident person, who was apparently free of any doubt.

Still curious, however, I have since been trying to figure out what the consensus is on the data re:geocentrism.

As far as I could understand, he's stating that the [MM experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson-Morley_experiment), the [CMB data from WMAP and SSDS](http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2012/09/newest-observational-evidence-shows.html), and just recently the [Planck data](http://magisterialfundies.blogspot.com/2013/03/copernican-principle-1532-2013-rip-why.html) all point to the Earth as being a privileged, non-relativistic frame.

I've checked out [Plait's response](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/09/14/geocentrism-seriously/#.UUycXhxwpOg) to some non-specific Geocentrist claims, and incedentally Delano's [friend's response to it](http://www.galileowaswrong.com/galileowaswrong/features/5.pdf).

I have also watched the 4 [extant videos created by CHL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wyRJZbNmC7U#!), as well as various wikipedia/rationalwiki pages etc...

But I was hoping for specific refutations of the things linked above, MMX and CMB information. I realize that this guy is a fundamentalist, and as such isn't susceptible to the kind of reason that sways me, but I would like to get a better grasp on the size and scope of his wrongness. 

**EDIT**

So, first of all, thanks to all those who took the time and effort to give responses to my original questions, many of them were very informative. As my first experience posting on askscience, and reddit in general, this has gone better than it could have.

Next; an apology.

I was originally thinking of posting these questions in one of the atheism, debate religion, or philosophy subs, but in the end I went with askScience because I figured there would be more experts in the relevant Astronomy/Astrophysics/Physics subjects here.

I arrived at these questions through my interactions with religious people on their blogs. I had never encounter a modern-day geocentrist before, and so was unwilling to continue discussing the points he made with the little information I had at my disposal at the time. Not having NdGT's, Kaku's, Hawking's or Plait's numbers on hand anymore, I thought I might try to get these questions answered here.

I then made the mistake of linking directly to that person's blog in my OP, which I am assuming is to blame for his incredibly quick arrival at this thread. I hope that the distinction is clear between my OP, looking for factual information about real data and theory, and the person who later made an appearance here. My training is as a computer scientist, and though I was contemplating copy-pastaing the blog-points which I eventually linked to, something about the unnecessary duplication of a wall o' text verbatim is nails/chalkboard to me. I realize now that there may have been unforeseen negatives to that decision, which would have made it worth while to spend the time.

I've noted the shocked tone of some of the original responses, followed by frustration and eventually dismissal. I personally feel that any and all questions are healthy and important to ask, so long as one is willing and capable of accepting the best answers provided by reason and evidence, so I sympathize.

Whether or not this thread eventually devolved into more noise than signal is obviously up to you to decide, but for my part I got some questions answered, and I suppose I got to eat some popcorn while an intellectual train wreck occurred in front of me.

I will attempt to collect a quick list of the information that I've learned as a result of this, and post it below.",Astronomy,2013-03-22 11:27:07,longshank_s,1,0.51,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1atafd/does_new_evidence_point_to_geocentrism/

1984,Is the uncertainty in the universe possibly a sign that we are a simulation?,"I was thinking about the possibility that we're a simulation awhile back, and considered that to perfectly represent our universe, if we wanted to do it, we would need an immense amount of storage. 

The language of computers is in 1s and 0s, right? And so to correctly represent the universe, you'd need a mechanism which represents yes/no. The best I could come up with was elections which have a up or down spin with one representing 1, the other representing 0. However, in such a system, the amount of electrons would be insufficient to represent the information necessary to simulate our universe assuming that the 'real' universe is the size of our universe and has the same laws of physics/particles.

With only electron spin, though, you could store only the up or down spin of the electron in the simulation, so the best you could simulate is a universe with an equivalent amount of electrons, but only their spin all at once. Nothing about their location, velocity, size, charge.  

Then I realized that what I'm describing isn't really how the universe works. There's uncertainty. Einstein says that God Doesn't Play Dice, and the consensus I've always seen is that he's actually wrong about that.

We are Stephanie Walton and Whit Pepper, scientist and chief commercial officer of clean-air company ATMOFIZER with patented technology designed to reduce indoor ultra-fine particles and deactivate airborne viruses/bacteria without using a filter. Ask us Anything!","**What are you doing to get clean air?**

As the fear of airborne illnesses has heightened, people have understandably become much more concerned about potentially contagious strangers and are choosing to go where high air quality standards are maintained. Conventional approaches have been focused on making filters tighter, but filter media can only be made so small before becoming difficult to move air effectively or efficiently. Reducing nanoparticles by agglomerating them into larger, aggregated clusters is the key. Larger particles are more easily mitigated and fall to the ground more quickly. [Atmofizer](https://atmofizer.com/) is leading 4th generation in air technology, with patented agglomeration tech using acoustic pressure waves to reduce airborne nanoscopic particles-without using filters and saving our landfills! Another benefit we hear is the reduction of odors, including strong smoke odors like cannabis. Cleaner air apparently smells a lot better too!

immediately followed an outcome of heads, and compute the relative frequency of heads on those

* A podcast with a physician: [https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus/12134820](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/coronacast/how-to-get-groceries-without-bringing-home-coronavirus/12134820)
* And the Mayo Clinic: [https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/)

Some claim it is indeed the most effective method.

The claim is that the virus has a lipid layer, and therefore soap or detergent will interfere with that layer and is therefore a highly effective way of destroying the virus.

However, I have not been able to find any actual research to back this claim.  

The only study I have found that tested this is here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext#sec1)

In that study, they compared several disinfectants, including hand soap.  Out of all tested, hand soap was the only disinfectant found to still have active virus after 5 minutes.  That is, it was the worst performer.

The CDC lists disinfectants believed to be effective against the virus, but not included in that list is detergent.  In their recommendations the suggest using detergent or soap followed by a disinfectant:

>If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html)

To be clear, I am not asking whether washing your hands with soap is effective, as I understand there is plenty of good evidence for this.  My understanding is that the mechanism of action is to physically remove the virus from your hands, rather than to inactivate it.  My question is about whether soap is an effective way of destroying the virus on surfaces as claimed in the above articles.

Is there evidence to support this claim?",COVID-19,2020-04-08 23:13:18,jatoo,2,0.54,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fxn46h/is_there_any_scientific_evidence_that_soap_is/

2055,Why was the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory abandoned?,"I'm starting to learn the basics of quantum mechanics with the goal to learn quantum field theory. As I understand, the concept of spin is fundamental to quantum theories, so I want to understand how people came to its discovery and how the formalism was derived and defined.

&#x200B;

Being sceptical I also try to understand the history of the field concept. At first the field was just a background on which particles (as the atoms of matter/energy) acted, but only the particles were ""real"" (basically as the test subject of the field); so the field was an abstract concept, in the same way as ""spin"" is an abstract concept.

At which point was it decided that ""the field(s)"" is a real physical entity? 

&#x200B;

I understand that whatever error makes the formulation of a unified theory an impossible task, was made in the 1920s/1930s. It could be a simple thing like a translation error from German to English and back, it could be a logical/mathematical error in the definitions of the concepts. It could be the guilt of Dirac who ignored the discussions which led to the Copenhagen interpretation and just kept on working on a fundamentally wrong theory, but one which works almost perfectly.

And there's no out currently because everything works too well, nobody wants to give up the field. It reminds me of the switch from Geocentrism to Heliocentrism: Heliocentrism as a theory was worse back then, it took some time to iron out the problems.

&#x200B;

It seems that Wheeler/Feynman didn't buy the foundations of the then current physics and tried to base a theory on the ""action at a distance""; but it seems that it was abandoned, seeing the success of GR and QM.",Physics,2019-07-09 08:16:34,PinkOwls_,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/cb26zy/why_was_the_wheelerfeynman_absorber_theory/

2078,Does Plan B have post-fertilization effects?,"Hi everyone! I have been doing a lot of research recently on the way that Plan B works and have happened upon a lot of mixed information. According to a lot of current research, Plan B has been proven to have no post-fertilization effects specifically regarding an alteration of the endrometrium. However, I also happened upon a fairly recent article:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102184/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5102184/)

That claims the following: ""The mechanism of action of LNG-EC is reviewed. The drug has no ability to alter sperm function at doses used *in vivo* and has limited ability to suppress ovulation. Our analysis estimates that the drug's ovulatory inhibition potential could prevent less than 15 percent of potential conceptions, thus making a pre-fertilization mechanism of action significantly less likely than previously thought. Luteal effects (such as decreased progesterone, altered glycodelin levels, and shortened luteal phase) present in the literature may suggest a pre-ovulatory induced post-fertilization drug effect.""

The evidence seems pretty compelling to point towards the fact that pre-fertilization effects of the drug are not the sole method of pregnancy prevention, or even the most common method. As someone who believes that life begins at conception, this is troubling for me. I took a Plan B thinking it would have no adverse affects on a potential embryo that had already formed in me, and then I experienced bleeding the next few days which made me want to research more into Plan B's potential to act as an abortifacient.

TL:DR: Research surrounding Plan B is highly contested, but articles such as the one above suggest that Plan B has post-fertilization effects. As someone who believes that life begins at conception this is troubling since many other sources are spreading the idea that Plan B poses no threat to an embryo. What are your thoughts on this?

However, if we took the average of all humans for each feature, the people who are over and people who are under would cancel out and the end result for average human (or maybe average male and average female separately) would fit all the ideal metrics. This is kind of similar reasoning to ""Wisdom of the Crowd"" (see: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\_of\_the\_crowd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)) phenomenon, but rather than a crowd's intellect, it's a crowd's (species') physical attractiveness.

2093,"They say nothing can be faster than the speed of light. But what is ""speed"" without a reference point? How do we measure speed in space? And why would my following example not be possible according to current theories about the speed of light?","Example:

This is my own home grown ""theory"" claiming that stuff *can* in fact go faster than the ""speed"" of light.

Let's say all sorts of planetary and star-like  bodies in this universe are moving all over the place. We are rotating around the sun, but for what it's worth our sun might be moving in relation to another body in space as well. Which in turn might have some sort of speed/direction in relation to another body in space. What if this would create a chain, which would eventually, theoretically, line up perfectly, and meet another chain that has lined up perfectly as well, but in the other ""direction"", meet each other at the ""fastest"" point of the chain? This ""speed"" of the chain would in this case be referenced to the first body which in this theory doesn't have a relevant motion.

The way this all works out in my head is that, theoretically, those two ""fastest"" bodies would have some sort of speed. (but both compared tho which reference point? Could you take just one of the two starting points?) And when they meet, would it's speed effectively be ""zero"" on one of the planets, and double the ""speed"" that both are moving on the other planet?

If so, then if the chain is long enough, why wouldn't they be able to reach a ""speed"" faster than light when they collide or closely pass each other?

In this entire story and theory, I just have to get back to the point that speed is a funny thing because of reference points etc. and you could totally say it's very relative. If it's relative then how can we claim light to be the fastest thing?

Also, how do we ""know"" it's the fastest thing? Is it just because we just don't know of anything that is faster?(which would be very stupid reasoning in my book) Or is there some solid math behind this?


On a related point, if galaxies are moving towards each other, these would have immense speed as well, but if light as the absolute highest speed, what would possibly be the thing that is limiting the speed of galaxies? and compared to *what*?

2094,"""Pre-baking marijuana before consumption increases potency"" - Is there any actual science to this?","I'm sorry, I know this question isn't as intellectually stimulating as most of the stuff posted here, but it's relevant to my interests. I ran several searches beforehand, but while there were a lot of pot-related questions, this didn't seem to be one of them. 

On this [forum ](http://buymarijuanaseeds.com/community/threads/pre-baking-marijuana.114442/)**(NSFW)**, and many others, there appears to be a school of thought that baking marijuana at relatively low temperatures - prior to smoking - activates more of the THC.

The reasoning boils down to this sentence: 

>In whole-plant cannabis, THC content is expressed as THCA (tetrahydrocannabolic acid) prior to decarboxylation into THC, which takes place when cannabis is heated during cooking, and smoked or vaporized ingestion. THCA is a mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory but does not have good affinity with our CB1 receptors...

While I'm familiar with marijuana vaporization, this seems to be something different. Traditionally vaporized pot is less potent afterwards, not more. Naturally, marijuana user forums are not known for the their rigorous citation, so I can't find any evidence aside from ""I tried it and it totally worked."" I realize this question is vulnerable to all sorts of layman speculation, but I'm hoping to avoid that.

He explained that we were able to detect nutrinos from a supernova prior to arriving light from the explosion. He explained a theory that posited that the nutrinos were released at the speed of light a moment before everything else while everything else accelerated slowly within the star until reaching the surface and then accelerating to the speed of light. Thus giving the nutrinos a head start.


My question is this: was the basis for this theory that the cosmic speed limit of light speed must be true and so nutrinos must have come out earlier, or have we independently verified that they were released earlier than the other stuff?

My concern is that our limited ability to test nutrinos may cloud our reasoning and that they may exceed the speed of light. But that we aren't taking that into account in our research.

2123,Have photons a mass?,"One time in Biology class my teacher asked what light is. I said it can be described as a particle without mass (a photon), or a wave. He then said that i am wrong and a photon has mass.

I researched alot...

I come to the conclusion that a Photon has no mass. My ""Evidence"" was:

E²=(mc²)² + (pc)²          because m(restmass) = 0 

its E²=(pc)² or E= pc      

because E=gamma*m*c² and p = gamma*m*v its:

v=c      so if m hits 0 v becomes c. a photon defines the speed of light...

My teacher then said following:

1. A Photon has to own a mass because its influenced by gravity.
2. A Photon has mass because it has momentum (p=mv)
3. A Photon has mass on its flight but not when it hits something.. the mass (magicaly) dissapears as soon as it hits an object... 
My Questions to you poeple are:

1. Can i Use p=mv on a Photon or do i Use p=E/c? and why?
2. Are Photons influenced by gravity because of their mass or because of the bended space?
3. Can a Photon bend space? (does mass bend space or does Energy bend it?)
4. Is it possible for a Photon to own a mass on its flight? (and only on that.)
5. and how is it able to move with the speed of light when it owns a mass?

2152,"I know this is an topic, but how credible is this article on the effects of violent video games?","Title was mean to say ""I know this is an old topic"" my bad.

Article in question: http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2003/10/anderson.aspx

The statements that Dr. Craig Anderson make seem a little odd.

This for example: Myth 6. There are no studies linking violent video game play to serious aggression. 
Facts: High levels of violent video game exposure have been linked to delinquency, fighting at school and during free play periods, and violent criminal behavior (e.g., self-reported assault, robbery).

He doesn't really say if it's a huge reason why those acts happen or if its just a factor. Also it seems odd since last I checked there wasn't any epidemic of robberies and assault done in the name of video games. Or is it the same old, oh this person played violent video games and robbed someone/attacked someone, clearly the video games were on of the main reasons! I don't see my friends going around robbing people or attacking them. Sure some people do it, but isn't because its violent video games on top of being already mentally aggressive and having a troubled youth? Also the whole delinquency angle sounds strange to me, is there any merit to that claim outside of his own study?

Another statement he makes that I find odd: Myth 11. If violent video games cause increases in aggression, violent crime rates in the U.S. would be increasing instead of decreasing. 
Facts: Three assumptions must all be true for this myth to be valid: (a) exposure to violent media (including video games) is increasing; (b) youth violent crime rates are decreasing; (c) video game violence is the only (or the primary) factor contributing to societal violence. The first assumption is probably true. The second is not true, as reported by the 2001 Report of the Surgeon General on Youth Violence (Figure 2-7, p. 25). The third is clearly untrue. Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this.

Pay attention to this ""Media violence is only one of many factors that contribute to societal violence and is certainly not the most important one. Media violence researchers have repeatedly noted this."" He stated that video games have been linked to robbery and assault, but says it is only a small factor now. It sounds like he was trying to make video games sound WAY worse than they really are. Also what annoys me about this whole article, is that it doesn't touch on the subject of do video games directly make people violent. As in if I don't have other risk factors or I have very few, could video games alone make me into a violent person?

Anyways thanks to whoever has read this, if you are a professional on this type of stuff I would really appreciate an answer/perspective. Thanks in advance!


Edit: Another claim he made in a testimony to the senate: Myth 2. Violent media have harmful effects only on a very small minority of people who use these media. One version of this myth is commonly generated by parents who allow their children to watch violent movies and play violent games. It generally sounds like this, ""My 12 year old son watches violent TV shows, goes to violent movies, and plays violent video games, and he's never killed anyone."" Of course, most people who consume high levels of violent media, adults or youth, do not end up in prison for violent crimes. Most smokers do not die of lung cancer, either. The more relevant question is whether many (or most) people become more angry, aggressive, and violent as a result of being exposed to high levels of media violence. Are they more likely to slap a child or spouse when provoked? Are they more likely to drive aggressively, and display ""road rage?"" Are they more likely to assault co-workers? The answer is a clear yes.

Where is the evidence for this clear yes? I never slapped a child or any of my family members. I never assaulted a co-worker. Only person I ever fought were bullies who harassed me.

2171,Why don’t we see clear evidence of seasonal changes in antiquity?,"  

I was recently considering the precessional cycle of the earth (25,920 years) and the fact that the seasons should swap at the half-way point.  Since the earth's tilt will be completely tilted in the opposite direction every \~13k years, we can expect summer to be in January in the northern hemisphere in the year 15,020 CE.  However, we should be able to see a continual shift in the date of the seasons as the earth's tilt precesses.  So, I was thinking:

&#x200B;

1. Half the precession of the equinox is \~13k years
2. 13k years to shift summer to winter (roughly 180 day      shift of the seasons)
3. 20% of this shift would be 36 days and should take 2600      years.
4. I think we should recognize a 36 day shift in the      seasons.

I tried to find some data on the summer harvest dates or seasonal changes, but I haven't found anything yet.  I found a reference in Robert Sallares book, ""The ecology of the ancient Greek world"", where on page 391 he says: "" A consensus has developed among ancient historians that the climate of Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE was virtually identical to the present-day climate.""

This would suggest that the precession of the earth’s axis has no effect on the seasons.  That doesn't make sense.  So, I was wondering anyone has any data or knows of any paper on this topic.

For 3^x, the result is always 57.7%, for 4^x the result is always 50% and so on.

Are excess protons in an acidic solution bound to water as hydronium (H30)?  Is there ever an excess of H+ where these protons are not bound to anything?  Does hydroxide (-OH) even exist freely in basic solutions?  Are there any impossibilities in terms of the acidity/basisity (e.g. a base removes all hydrogens from water)?

It was triggered by me messing around with the square root function on my calculator and then realizing the square root of a decimal is higher than the original number.

Conventionally, multiplying something should always return a ""larger"" number compared to adding them. So I found this pretty counter intuitive.

(e.g 0.5 + 0.5 = 1     but   0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25)

(but   5  + 5   = 10    and      5   *   5 = 25)

To the extent of my knowledge, hand washing didn't really become a thing until quite recently.

I don't see any reason to believe the mental state leading to hypochondria is somehow unique to the modern era. What sort of paranoia or obsessions gripped these people a few hundred years ago (or earlier, Rome perhaps?), back when poor hygiene was the norm? Was hypochondria just seen as a more general kind of obsession or mania?

> In his 1996 book The Conscious Mind,[4] David Chalmers argues that a theory of everything must explain consciousness, that consciousness does not logically supervene on the physical, and that therefore a fundamental theory in physics would not be a theory of everything. A truly final theory, he argues, needs not just physical properties and laws, but phenomenal or protophenomenal properties and psychophysical laws explaining the relationship between physical processes and conscious experience. He concludes that ""[o]nce we have a fundamental theory of consciousness to accompany a fundamental theory in physics, we may truly have a theory of everything.""

2333,Is there a reason for a baby to be aborted vs. birthed in a late-term pregnancy for the health of the mother?,"With New York signing the Reproductive Health Act, now women are able to get late-term (in this case, beyond 24 weeks) abortions if it endangers either the mother's life *or* health. From what I can find, at 24 weeks the baby has a 70% chance of surviving outside of the womb, which goes up to 90% at 27 weeks.

Assuming that the baby is healthy and viable (as I know there are complications like a tumor or Dandy-Walker syndrome which results in a stillbirth or a baby that's in pain where abortion is necessary to prevent suffering), what are some examples of when a baby would have to be aborted versus delivered (via c-section or actual birth)? Can the birthing process itself endanger a mother's health, where abortion would be the safer option?

So I thought about theortically possible things which may be more powerful, such as anti matter bombs/missiles and kinetic bombardment by accelerating an object to nearly the speed of light.

But both creating significant amounts of antimatter and accelerating even a kg object to 99% of lightspeed or there about requires absolutely ridiculous amounts of power, power comparable to the energy released by the largest nuclear weapons in human history, or the amount of power the entire United States generates over days, even months. Enough energy I would imagine that we human are not even aware of a way a stereotypical starship could generate let alone contain that much power, To say nothing of the fact that were it rounded to some sort of gun or equipment it would vaporize it.

So all you scientists, is it even possible as far as we know? Is there some way we think we could theoretically generate massive amounts of power?

2338,Why are Amps an SI unit? Wouldn't charge make more sense?,"Looking at the SI units, You have the basic units measuring space, time, mass and temperature which can together build up pretty much all of dynamics and thermodynamics when combined in different ways. 

However, it seems to me that amps are a weird choice for the SI unit for electricity. current is the measure of how much charge passes in a certain time Seeing as charge is a property of fundamental particles it makes more sense to have coulombs as an SI unit and have amps defined as coulombs per seconds rather than the other way around. 

Comparably, I think having amps as an SI unit is like having velocity as an SI unit and length being defined as velocity x time. 

On my own research there's alot about how amps is defined but not much as to why it was chosen as an SI unit. I thought it could have something to do with the development of electricity but can't seem to find much on that. Can anyone help?

2396,"How long does the ""Present"" last???","How long does the ""Present"" last???

I don't know much about astronomy. But as I understand, if a star is 20 light years away from us, by the time we receive the light emitted from the star, we are actually seeing the star as it was 20 years ago. If I am wrong, then just tell me and I'll stop asking stupid questions :)

Now, what happens with close objects.

Again, as I understand, every object we see, we see it because it is actually reflecting the light that surrounds it.
The time it takes for a light reflection from an object that is 2 meters away from us to reach our eyes might be incredibly small; and for the purpose of this question, let's suppose that it takes 2 nanoseconds for the light reflected from an object 2 meters away to reach our eyes. So we are actually seeing the object as it was 2 nanoseconds in the past.

Does the ""Present"" actually exist? is everything near or far that we see, already in the ""Past""? Is time really so relative that my ""Present"" is not yours? Does it really mean that no one that reads this post is actually sharing the same ""Present""?

While me and some friends where discussing the 0/0 problem, we hit the question if the concept of Zero and Infinity exist on an cosmic scale in our universe. 

Here are two examples what I am meaning:

1.) Speed/Energy: As we all know the maximum speed possible in this universe is c, the speed of light, is it possible, that something contains more energy than an object moving at the speed of light?
Also does zero speed, the true stop of matter and consequential the absence of energy exist? I know it's impossible to reach Absolute Zero, so I guess the answer is no, but does a solid proof exist?

2.) Same question as above but let's look at matter instead of energy. Space starts to behave weird when too much matter is concentrated at one point, but is the singularity truly infinite? 
And final question, is the vast space complete empty (complete absence of matter) or could there be something we don't know of?

tl:dr: Can energy be infinite / is it possible that energy is complete absence? Same question with matter.

Thanks for your answers.

At the distance Europa is from the Sun, it should have a stable temperature below the freezing point of water. However, its elliptical orbit around Jupiter causes friction in the oceans, which generates heat and keeps liquid water beneath the surface. My first thought about where that energy comes from was gravitational PE as it gets closer to Jupiter, but then it just gets farther away again, so that doesn't work out. So what on Earth is losing energy as Europa gains it?

One of the question is the following : there is two parallel pipes, crossing only at particular places (where collision detectors are, obviously).
According to drawings and explanations i found, these two pipes are arranged so they are side by side (they have the same altitude).

This seems odd to me because (1) this makes the outer pipe longer than the inner pipe, since they both follow the same line and (2) needs more complex arrangement of the magnets that curves the particles trajectory.
This probably have a consequence on computations and engineering implementation.

On the other hand, making them stacked up would not change anything about how the LHC works, but would counteract the one-is-longer-than-the-other effects.

2450,"What's the average number of attempts necessary to reach 1,000 successes at a 1% rate?","So in statistics I understand that, given a 1% chance of success, it will take an average of 68.something attempts to succeed, because the equation is .99^x = .5 and you solve for x.  However, does that mean that the average attempts to get, say, 1,000 successes at a 1% rate would be ~68,000?  On one hand, it makes sense that you would just multiply the average attempts by the number of successes necessary.  However, looking at it from the standpoint of common sense, a 1/100 chance times 1,000 necessary successes should just be 100*1,000.  Which number is correct (if either) and why?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: for further clarification, I'm basically asking a question that's an extension of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/25qsv7/eli5_if_i_attempt_something_with_1_probability) old Reddit post.  If .99^100 = X and X is about .64, then you can just substitute X for number of attempts instead of probability and thus find the average number of attempts in order to have any given chance of success, correct?  That is, .99^x = .5, so x =68.9676.  This seems to assert that, after about 69 attempts, you would have a 50% chance of success.  So why doesn't that translate into chance of having a certain number of successes within a certain number of attempts?  Or why is this number not 100, since intuitively it should take an average of 100 attempts to succeed given a 1% chance of success?

2510,Are mutations overrated?,"I have observed that whenever questions about evolution and natural selection come up (here, or in other contexts), people providing answers are often quick to point out that randomly occuring *mutations* are responsible (and required) for introducing new or modified features in organisms, that are then selected for or against, determining the likelihood/rate of that mutation surviving in the gene pool.

However, as an interested layperson (my knowledge about evolutionary biology and genetics is mostly based on biology class back in school, and on reading popular science like Dawkins, Sagan, Bryson), my intuitive understanding of evolution and natural selection makes me believe that the *main* driving force behind the changes needed to keep evolution going is merely the *genetic variation* occuring ""naturally"" due to sexual reproduction, when the genes of two individuals are shuffeled and recombined. Sure, the occasional spontaneous mutation is needed as some sort of catalyst, speeding things up, and introducing radical changes that might turn out successful or not. But overall, mutations are by far not the main cause behind genetic modifications required for evolution - most of those are covered by standard genetic variation.

Now, I'm wondering: How accurate is that intuitive understanding of mine? Are there any numbers / estimates about how much influcence mutations have on the variety of the gene pool, as opposed to the variation already provided by sexual reproduction?

2523,Ummmm... Is the theory of evolution even answerable by the scientific method??,"So correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means a scientist, but for a hypothesis to be true in the framework of science it has to be **Observable, Repeatable, and Explainable**, right? Well how does one test for the repeatable factor? It's certainly explainable, and in arguably observable, but no way is it repeatable (I don't think). WTF?

A friend of mine told me that for the theory of evolution, the legal method of determining truth is far more practical, in which the matter at debate is neither observable (unless there's a tape) or repeatable. So using the legal method, again correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not a lawyer, the following factors are considered:

Was there a **motive**? (is there a reason)

Was there a window of **opportunity** for the accused? (is it possible)

Was there a **method**? (how could it have been done)

In regards to testimonies, are the sources **credible**?

In regards to testimonies, is there **corroborating evidence**?

So like, applying the legal method to Darwin's theory, the motive is the need for adaptation, the window of opportunity is over thousands of years, the method is biology, the credibility of the source can be up to debate, and I would argue that there is corroborating evidence, via historical studies such as the progress of change in a primate's skeletal structure over time.

I read somewhere that this relationship is obtained in the context of assuming that the electron's velocity distribution in a plasma is a temperature distribution. But this should apply to everyday situations, right? Like for example in justifying why Cooper pairs are unable to form at room temperature (because the bond energy is like 0.001 eV, which by the relationship above is about 11.6 K). But if a semiconductor has a bandgap of 2 eV, by the same relationship, you should expect that you need to heat it to like 24000 K in order for it to promote electrons to the conduction band.

2632,How does evolution work?,"Ok, so a while back, I had an argument with a professor of mine about how evolution works.

 I supported that evolution is the fact that random mutations occur to offsprings, which happen to be beneficial for the environment they live in, so they are more fit at surviving at that environment. Leading for easier reproduction for the individuals with that mutation, causing the mutation to prevail.  While the environment itself was not the cause of the mutation.

My professor said the the mutation occurred because of the external environment, and that they were not random. The example he gave me was that if a guy played the guitar from a young age, his fingers would get longer, so he would be more fit to play the guitar. So after a few generations, if his kids played the guitar also, they would create a family line with long fingers.

Which one is correct?

I'm not asking how light is observed or if planet A would observe planet B at 0.96c, i'm asking what is the physical location and velocity of the planets relative to each other.

&nbsp;

**Premise 2:**
Now let's say we are on Planet D, and we will use Planet D as the stationary reference point. Planets A and B start right beside us, Then suddenly both Planets shoot off in opposite directions at 0.75c each.

1 Year of Time has passed and now Planet A is exactly 0.75 LightYears of Distance away from us (Planet D)... and also Planet B is 0.75 LightYears in the opposite direction. correct???
So now Planet A and B are exactly 1.5 LightYears apart after 1 Year of Time???

&nbsp;

Now let's ignore Planet D and have a ride on planet A instead. After 1 Year of Time Planet B is now 1.5 LightYears away from us (Planet A), so surely that means Planet B was travelling at 1.5c relative to Planet A??? If they are 1.5 LightYears apart, then surely Planet B was truly travelling at a velocity of 1.5c relative to Planet A.... otherwise how would they be 1.5 LightYears apart.

So onto the title question again, if the Planets crashed into each other, then wouldn't Planet B impact Planet A at the true velocity of 1.5c and not 0.96c ??? Again I am not asking how Planet A observes the speed of light or observes Planet B. I am asking what the true velocity and physical location of the Planets are relative to each other. 

So if the answer is 0.96c, then doesn't that mean Premise 2 is incorrect and after 1 Year of time, A and B would be 0.96 Light years apart and not 1.5?

Assume Bob follows her into the black hole a few moments later. Once inside, Alice may want to chat with Bob about their predicament. However, Alice can't send a message to Bob -- time and space are flipped in a black hole, meaning that sending a message outward inside a black hole is like us sending a message backward in time outside a black hole.

So, she can't talk to Bob. But can the neurons in the front of her head send messages to the back of her head? My feeling is ""no"". So, at this point, there is no possible discussion of what an observer would view inside a black hole, since there is no way to maintain consciousness of any form inside a black hole.

Intuitively 'minus' something is a 'lack of' or 'debt' in something, but +/- electrical charges are just opposing charges, right? So I don't understand why, especially for chemical calculations and when visualising chemical mechanisms and such (where I was always taught to imagine the electrons moving and the protons being somewhat stationary, in diagrams), electrons weren't given a positive charge as I think electro-chemistry and understanding ions would be a lot easier to initially learn if that were the case. 
Is this something similar to the Pi/Tau argument (and ease of learning) or am I missing something fundamental?

How come that our brain function isn't influenced significantly by external temperature? I realize that there is a constant temperature regulating effect by blood circulation, which in turn depends on temperature regulation of the body. 
What I don't understand is:

(1) Why our brain functions don't seem to be influenced much by external temperature differences. You could walk outside in the winter and have your ears freeze off, which should lower your brain's temperature by at least 5-10 degrees, and not notice any effect. Then on the other hand you could stay in the sun for a while and almost get a heat stroke (which is the result of your brain expanding because of the heat and resulting high pressure levels inside the skull), but the symptoms wouldn't be related to the temperature difference but rather the physical condition of the brain.
tl;dr: why do temperature differences of maybe 15°C not influence our brain functions?

(2) Why is our brain not working better when it gets cooled down? Shouldn't more efficient heat transfer enhance neural functions?

Assumptions in question:
1. Humans dominate the earth, ergo we have the evolutionary advantage over all other animals
2. The predominant trait that allows us to dominate is our cognitive abilities
3. Gorillas may be""smart"", but according to evolution, we're part of the same family anyways. What about other animals?

Basis of my question: In my understanding, nature, when left to itself, doesn't allow a ""thriving"" species - there are always predators and a food chain. Therefore animals are always ""surviving"" and not thriving. 


But not human beings. Our brains have allowed us to ""thrive"" - why hasn't this evolutionary trait appeared in other species?

Feel free to bash my assumptions if need be. 


Edit* 

It looks like the consensus is "" Cognitive intelligence is not universally helpful to all species"". I can kind of accept that answer. But does anyone else feel, even a little, that that answer feels incomplete? That a singular trait that has helped the human race A LOT doesn't appear in any other animal? Am I crazy? 

Edit 2*

Changing my question slightly: 

Humans have been able to remove itself from Nature's food chain that apparently all other animals are a part of. What (if not our intelligence) allows this, and is it strange (or not) that no other creature been able to do so? 

If your reply is ""We're still part of the food chain, just on top"" then please explain why when one examines a food ecosystem without humans, that the higher you go up, the less creatures there are in terms of numbers. That is to say, 10 hares feed 4 snakes feed 1 hawk. Hawk is at the top, and there's only one. If we're at the top, explain why there are so darn many of us.

1728,Why doesn't the flu (unlike Covid) continually get more transmissible over time?,"Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we have repeatedly seen more transmissible variants emerge. As I understand it, this is evolutionarily almost inevitable: if a strain has a mutation that makes it more transmissible, it should generally outcompete less transmissible variants until it becomes dominant (exceptions being 1) if it is substantially more lethal such that it kills people before they can spread it, but this hasn't been a factor for Covid-19, and 2) if a variant is better able to overcome prior immunity, it may become dominant even if it doesn't have an inherent transmissibility advantage). This happened with Alpha, then Delta, the Omicron, etc. 

The implication seems to be that infectious diseases should have evolutionary pressures almost constantly pushing them towards greater infectiousness. 

However (to my understanding), the flu hasn't inevitably gotten more infectious over time. Instead, some seasons will have more infectious strains than others.

I take an advil, this gets dissolved by my saliva and stomach acids. The chemical(s) infused in the drug get transported in my bloodstream to all parts of my body. I assume then that this chemical (drug) binds to certain cells where the pain is emitted from. Is this only to nerve cells because that is where the pain signal is coming from correct? So this chemical (drug) will bind to nerve cells to block pain? What exactly is it binding to and for how long? Does this create changes within the cell simultaneously, for example would certain transcription factors be activated to yield the production of different proteins? So I guess I have a two part question: how does a drug (infused with a chemical) firstly accomplish its goal on a cellular level (in this case blocking pain), and by doing so does this affect the landscape of the intercellular environment - what does on inside the cell in anything when this chemical binds to the nerve cell to block pain.

1790,Why does a Slinky(tm) spring have so little resistance in compression but it has a bit of resistance under extension?,"My best guess is that the flat shape of the spring doesn't mind torsion but it is more resistant to flexion. 

If this is close, is it used in other applications to modify the resistance profile of coil springs?

Edit: Sometimes my mind just won't let things go. And since the comments are misunderstanding it is further reason to elaborate.

A coil spring seems like a hybrid of a torsion spring and a flexion spring. Flexion spring: think safety pin or leaf spring. Torsion spring: think paper clip. 

As a coil spring extends it becomes more sensitive to flexion and less sensitive to torsion. As it compresses it becomes more sensitive to torsion and less sensitive to flexion.  

So with the shape of the Slinky, it is easily deformed near its compressed state since it is sensitive to torsion. When it moves to its extended state the spring is more sensitive to flexion (on one axis) and so is harder to deform.

Say you have a brushed DC motor acting as a generator and you can connect different loads to it (10 ohms, 100ohms, 5ohms...) but you cannot control the input (like the wind). How does this affect both the mechanical output power AND the electric output power?
I'm thinking of renewable energy, and usually when in numerical modeling, mechanical power is used as Pmech =c*w^2 (damping times speed). With a higher electrical resistance as the load, the speed lowers but you have a higher damping value. If you were to graph this there is some ""knee"" of optimal damping to yield highest mechanical power.
But what happens with electrical power? With a higher load, the generator would move slower, and produce less voltage. So wouldn't we have Pelec = V^(2)/R, where V is lower and R is high, creating an overall low electric power?

From what I understand, if you pressurize water, you decrease the space for the molecules to spread out, actively lowering the melting point.

If it’s true that ice can form under pressure, does it form eventually when there’s not enough space for the molecules to rapidly bond/unbond?

Basically it just allows fuel to burn more effectively by providing extra oxygen for ignition in cylinders.

It raised a question in me:In regular gas engined vehicles the gas pedal increases flow of fuel to cylinders. Optimal ignition requires exact proportions of fuel and air (oxygen source).

Could there be a threshold where pushing pedal injects so much fuel that it starts to take up so much space that could be used for air that in result it decreases power output?

Is there any truth to my thoughts? Are there any mechanisms that prevent this?

1845,Why are ionization energies so much larger than electron affinities?,"As I understand it, the ionization energy is the energy required to take an electron away, off of an atom. Electron affinity, on the other hand is kind of the opposite, as it's the amount of energy given off when an electron is given to an atom. As such, I thought they'd be similar in terms of value.

I've been looking at charts of electron affinity and first ionization energies, and it seems that that's not the case, however. For example, hydrogen has an ionization energy of 1312 kJ/mol... but an electron affinity of only 73 kJ/mol. What's up with that? The electron affinity is less than a tenth of the ionization energy. Both values deal in putting/removing an electron around the hydrogen atom... why does the change in energy vary so much? This doesn't seem to just be hydrogen, either, as even the lowest first ionization energy (Fr, ~380 kJ/mol) is larger than the largest electron affinity (Cl ~349 kJ/mol).

I've been trying to understand this and in looking further I've only gotten more confused by looking at standard enthalpy of formation too... If I want to make a mole of NaCl, I'd have to take a mole of Na, and a mole of Cl, and move the electron from every Na atom to a Cl one, right? So that's 496 kJ/mol to take the electrons off of Na, and 349 kJ/mol back when I give them to Cl, so I guessed that this whole process should take 147 kJ. But the standard enthalpy of formation of NaCl is about -411 kJ/mol, which means its an exothermic reaction. Where is this additional ~558 kJ/mol coming from?

1854,Are charcoals in soils always a good thing? I.e. Biochars and post processing,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9g9l5CjGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB9g9l5CjGk)

Charcoals have polar surfaces with tremendous numbers of nooks and crannies and are found ubiquitously in the world's soils deposited from fire. These legacy structures modulate soil fertility, individual plant response, and subsequent large-scale ecosystem patterns.

In recent years, incredible attention has been paid to their use as a soil amendment - converting waste biomass into charcoals, ""biochars"" - dually capturing carbon and increasing soil fertility in managed ecosystems. Most data synthesis, including my own with Dr. Sean Thomas at Toronto, show on average \~41% increase in biomass responses.

However, much variation ensues from the applied usage in agricultural and forestry contexts - including negative responses. The mechanisms that drive these detrimental effects are many. Still, research shows that low molecular weight leachates (i.e., acids, phenols, VOCs), Ash, and sometimes metals could be responsible for a mismatch in soil physiochemistry.

However, I couldn't find any explanations of why it takes this shape, or what determines the location of this peak. 

My understanding was that speed is, well, speed, while torque is the ability of a motor to start moving in the first place. So I thought that the efficiency would continuously increase with speed, until the torque is too low to move the load and the motor stalls, dropping efficiency straight to 0 rather than a gradual decrease.

(The method in brief: cover the mat with sea salt, let sit for 24 hours, wipe/scrub off, rinse, and allow to dry.) Can someone explain how this salt scrub method works?

ETA: Many people who have tried the salt scrub method report that it does not work, even after repeated attempts.

ETA2: Changed flair from Chemistry to Engineering.

ETA3: SOLVED: Skip the salt. The film is likely the release agent used in injection moulding. Using a household degreaser (e.g. dish soap, isopropyl alcohol) should remove the film.

2035,"(Geology) The ""polar wander hypothesis"" was debunked, but isn't the phenomenon of a wandering pole an actual thing since we've observed that magnetic North moves?","My textbook says

>As paleomagnetists sampled and measured older and older rocks, **their results seemed to show that the north magnetic pole was far from the modern pole and appeared to wander through time**. This was called the “polar wander hypothesis” at first. But then they ran into a problem. Each continent had a completely different polar wander curve, which only converged on a common magnetic pole today. These data seemed to suggest that the magnetic field had behaved very strangely in the past, with multiple directions of magnetic north that no longer exist. As outrageous as that  idea seemed, the only alternative was just as radical: **the continents had moved through time, so it was not the magnetic pole that was changing but the continents** **that recorded their directions**. But when you lined up the polar wander curves for two different continents, like Europe and North America, you found that they matched once you moved  the continents back together as Wegener had suggested. **In other words, the “polar wander curves” were only apparent polar wander curves because it was the continents that moved, not the magnetic poles.**

What I'm confused about is my book saying, ""the continents had moved through time, so it was *not the magnetic pole that was changing*"" because isn't that not completely true since magnetic North DOES move? We've observed this movement, so isn't my book completely dismissing the idea of a ""wandering pole"" incorrect?

Everything I've watched and read online only talks about the effect of continental drift on the apparent wander curves, but they haven't talked about how the magnetic North pole does, in fact, move.

2089,How does velocity through space affect perception of time?,"Hello, me and a friend were just watching some vids about time dilation and me and my buddy are trying to figure out where our logic is wrong here, so it would be great to see what we are missing.

Understandings:

**When moving at the speed of light away from a clock, the clock would be perceived as 'frozen' to the travelling person's eyes.**

What I don't understand about this is that, from what I know the way the eye works is that light must hit the retina for my brain to perceive an image. But surely if I'm moving away at the same speed the light is (both constant speeds), then the first bit of light might hit my eye, but after that there is no distance being made between the light and my eye since both are the same constant speed (for example 2 cars travelling in front of each other in the same direction at the same speed would never actually hit). Surely nothing would be hitting my eye anymore.

What am I missing here?

**I have heard a lot that time dilation is just perspective, just like when I mentioned above, time seemed to be frozen due to moving away from the clock at the speed of light.**

What I also don't get about this is that, time 'seems' to be frozen, however this is just because the light is not given the chance to hit my retina, surely that's just a visual effect. I have heard that time dilation could theoretically affect how you would age compared to another perspective, but I just don't see how that is the case since everything is to do with 'perspective'.

Surely travelling away from that clock at the speed of light doesn't actually stop time for me as an observer, it just stops me seeing the light coming off of it which tells me the clock is ticking. When I return back to earth, everything would have aged the same amount as me?

They found a direct relationship between body mass and jump distance, with lighter simulated athletes attaining longer jump distances and more airtime.

How is this possible? If you have two objects of the same size and drop them from the same height, they fall at the same speed. So why is it that when body size, air resistance, angle of flight, etc are all held the same, mass still influences jump distance?

I know that the athlete's trajectory has a horizontal component as well as a vertical. So from my understanding, mass shouldn't affect the vertical component (acceleration due to gravity). How does it affect the horizontal component, when takeoff velocity (the forward acting force) and air resistance (the inhibiting force) are held the same?

Does new precipitation continuously added to the top make the ice cap basically fresh water anyway?) Or was it thicker, because the climate was colder?     
2) Did the polar cap rest on the ocean floor? Was the ice cap grounded in places, like on the Langseth Ridge?

 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YwpJc6Ii8OM


Just wondering if the safety lancet in the video could somehow :

1)be fired (by being pressed down onto someones skin)

2)compress itself back to a near fully compressed state after it reached its maxed extended state and started returning(>99%, almost no losses whatsoever like extremely extremely small) where the plastic hooks could hold it back in place (imagine the spring rebounding and the hooks being allowed to return to their original position because the user has stopped applying pressure to the persons skin thereby allowing the hooks to return to their original position  therefore recapturing the spring in its original position)***

Best example i can think of is an automatic gun where the firing pin is ready to strike the primer of the bullet again without manually compressing the hammer like in a revolver , i know a gun uses the recoil from the cartridge explosion to reload just the closest thing i can think of

All this without any other intervention , solely the device as it is. Maybe some sort of system with extremely low losses? So low that the spring is retracted to almost the same height as it started from. I know there would be a ton of calculations to get the spring to return just as the hooks were returning back ot their original position , just wondering if this is possible. In my head if the losses were extremely small to the point you could barely even see the losses this would be possible because the hooks would recapture the spring replacing the energy lost to friction and piercing of the skin , but i have minimal knowledge of physics & engineering and wanted to ask the experts.

Not trying to design a reusable lancet. Just want to know if its possible. I know safety lancets are for the most part designed to be single use. I just feel that if the losses were extremely small it would be possible

2137,"Why does IR pass through dust more easily than visible light, but not the atmosphere?","In Fourier's paper on Earth's climate, he says that the earth gains heat through mostly visible light from the sun and loses it more slowly though IR radiation. He says that this is because the slower IR rays have a more difficult time passing through clear bodies in the atmosphere than visible light (which I kinda assumed was because IR moves more slowly than visible light), and upon contact with the opaque surface of the earth, the visible light is converted to IR. But I read recently that infrared can pass through dense gasses, some of which are even opaque - I understand that since it came out in the early 1800's, Fourier's paper is a little outdated

So is he wrong? Can IR pass through thick dust and gas, but not the atmosphere? If so, why? From what I've read, the resonance structure of CO2 absorbs infrared but if that's why, why does de Saussure's box (a few panes of glass above a black cork body placed in the sunlight, leading to intensely heated chambers) have the same effect? (also, how is visible light converted to IR upon contact with opaque bodies?)

Sorry if this question is written badly or stupid, I'm a dumb plant & soil science sophomore

\-Cardarine is a  PPARδ receptor agonist that works by regulating expression of genes associated with contractile proteins, mitochondrial biogenesis, and lipid oxidation...essentially switching your body's preferred energy source from carbs to almost exclusively fat. It is believed this is the mechanism of action that causes the increase in endurance from cardarine.

\-Meldonium works by reducing the amount of carnitine in your body, which is needed for fat oxidation - thus reducing the oxidation of fat for energy and switching your body's preferred energy source to carbohydrates. It is believed this is the mechanism behind meldonium's ability to increase endurance.

So cardarine switches your body to burning only fat, which increases endurance...

And meldonium switches your body to burning only carbohydrates, which also increases endurance?

If I remember rightly, receptors that produce EPSPs are on the more distal part of the dendrites, while IPSP-producing receptors are either directly on the soma or at least on more proximal parts of the dendrites. The ""explanation"" (not so much of the mechanism which is obviously to do with ions and G proteins, rather it was more a way of thinking of it that helps you remember it, supposedly) was that it was like the IPSPs had to originate along the pathway EPSPs took to the axon hillock so they could intercept them. Or, it may have been the other way round, that the EPSPs had to be closer so they could overcome the IPSPs. I clearly remember that something was overcoming something else; unfortunately, you can conceptualise that both ways.

Alternatively, the distinction may have been between the ionotropic and metabotropic receptors instead. Or, maybe, based on my lack of success Googling, neither of these things is true at all and you find receptors of all types all over the shop.

2214,Where does the energy of GRB come from? (and a few more questions)," A few questions I cannot really find the answer to.

It is theorised that neutron stars are formed when gravity compresses iron and other heavy atoms to the point where protons and electrons fuse together to form neutrons. As I understand, this is would be due to the electron capture process mediated by the W bosons. Which is the same process as the decay of free neutrons into protons, just in reverse. Is this because of the T symmetry of the weak force?

As for Gamma ray bursts

Do we know the actual mechanism of how they form? I mean, something more profound than the formation of a blackhole due to the collapse of a star or merge/collision.

Where does the released energy actually come from? Is it due to the fusion of whatever is inside a neutron star to whatever is inside of a black hole and/or particles disintegrating into pure energy/photons?

Secondly, why does it come out of the poles? Is it because of the star's magnetic field? But given that photons are neutrally charged, why would the magnetic field matter?

Thirdly, say you have a neutron star just on the edge of it's upper mass limit and a small comet crashes into to, taking it over the edge and making it collapse. Given the extraordinary amount of energy released by the GRB, would this mean that the mass of the resulting blackhole be lower than the one of the neutron star + comet?

For some reference, I found that the Krakatoa eruption is estimated to have released 8x10^(17) J of energy ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy))), as if the worldwide geothermal power capacity in 2019 was 15.4 GW / 15.4x10^(9) ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power)). So if the entire world's 2019 geothermal power generation capacity was concentrated on Krakatoa, then some basic calculations would mean it would take \~600 days to absorb all of the estimated energy released by Krakatoa:

>8x10^(17) / 15.4x10^(9) / 24 (hours in a day) / 60 (minutes in an hour) / 60 (seconds in a minute)

As of 2019, the US has 3.68 GW / 3.68x10^(9) ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_power)) geothermal power capacity installed, so this same situation would take \~2500 days to absorb all of the estimated energy released by Krakatoa.

2249,Nitinol shape memory effect vs superelasticity?,"I recently came across Nitinol, an alloy that can exhibit two properties. What confuses me is the training of superelastic nitinol.

So, the first one, the shape memory effect, works by ""training"" the alloy at high temperatures (around 500⁰C) into a shape it will ""remember"". So, later, at room temperature, it can be deformed into any other shape, but when heated (at about 75⁰C), it will return to the shape it was trained into.

The second, superelasticity, causes the alloy to resist deformation at room temperature. It remembers the shape it was trained into, as opposed to being heated to recover. 
How? How is this effect achieved at room temperature? Does the training temperature need to be lower or something?
From what i read online it has something to do with the nickel-to-titanium ratio, but that's about where my understanding of this whole process ends.

I was reading about non-pharmacological treatments for HF, and they mention heart transplantation, but further down it says that heart allografts do not function normally because of denervation. At first I thought they meant that receiving a heart allograft means you have to take life-long immunosuppresant therapy for it to work, but then I realized that the denervation part cannot be solved by immunosuppresants.

2288,How effective are masks as a covid-spread prevention measure? 1. How effective are FFP2? 2. How effective are ‘normal’ blue masks bought new in a supermarket? 3. And how effective are these blue masks when they have been used multiple times (let’s say 5-10)?,"
I think I said it pretty much in the title, but I am mostly curious what the research says about masks as a restriction and how it ranks its efficiency and effectiveness. And I made three sub-categories, as not everyone uses new masks after each time of using, which probably impairs the quality of masks. I realise that it’s silly to put used 5-10 times, as that creates many different cases and cannot really be generalised scientifically; however, maybe you understand where I come from, in asking about masks that have been reasonably used.

I've  recently started studying the Navier-Stokes equations, aerodynamics and  its application in CFD. From what I have understood, the Navier-Stokes  equations are based on three fluid assumptions:

\- Newtonian (which I've understood the implications of)

\- Incompressible

\- Isothermal

I  am wondering how the incompressible assumption is regarded for when  e.g. simulating an aircraft at some flight state, as air is  compressible(not incompressible) in ""reality"". From what I've learnt,  CFD (Ansys Fluent) is used in many aircraft applications for  understanding the aircraft characteristics, is the impact of the  incompressible fluid assumption small when it comes to the gathered  results from the simulation(s), or how do engineers tackle this?

I  am also curious about the Isothermal assumption, as I have seen that  there is an option for enabling heat transfer in Ansys Fluent. But the  Isothermal assumption implies that there is no heat add/loss to the  fluid as it flows, how is this incorporated/calculated within the CFD  software?",Physics,2022-02-02 11:17:56,Ok-Flounder2509,9.0,0.74,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/six77g/regarding_the_incompressible_flow_assumption_when/

Quaila is an experience sensory organs give data off, that the brain can understand. It’s not math, in the sense of science would put it. 

So. Why can’t perception of time be a sense? 


Our consciousness, is bound to perception of time. However, is it possible not experience time at all? 

Well in scenarios like sleeping, comatose, dementia you don’t experience time. So our “timesense” is offline. 

Would that mean, we could hypothetically could alter a part of the brain, that would change perception of time for an individual. Just like splashing water on a person would make them feel wet?

In biological terms I have been told that this is a pretty significant amount of energy for most operations at that scale.

However, The chemical energy released from burning gasoline is significantly greater than the movements of the larger ATP structure-- where the combustion of a single Octane chain (C8H12) into CO2 and H2O releases almost **94 eV of energy.**

Compared to that, the fission of a single uranium atom releases **200,000,000 eV** of energy, which is obviously a totally different realm of consideration with very different mechanisms at work.

As far as I understand, this  is to do with the relative difference in strength between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force that governs chemical bonding, but does this trend continue further down to the quantum level?

My question is, can the results of the study be explained using physics? What is damaging the sperm physically speaking? What am I missing?

I am from Pakistan. We have a dwindling supply of natural gas, and every day, more and more people are forced to abandon the hope of having a room that is amply heated. Simply because the available gas isn't even enough to power their stoves. For those that have an electric heater, they quickly realize that their electricity bill is skyrocketing and they simply cannot heat their rooms like the good old gas heater days. 

And since there's no way to significantly increase the efficiency of an electric heater, since it is literally a resistor converting almost all its current into heat, they will be forced to consider, what I can only define as ""thermal efficiency"". 

These thermal efficiency techniques can be something simple like reducing the size of the room to be heated by adding additional false ceilings and cubicle-like structures, to something much more drastic like an electric heating suit or robe that we can put on. 

Of course, this would not be necessary if somehow the cost of producing electricity is reduced to a point that efficiency doesn't matter anymore (like the good old gas heaters).

Let's say the secondary number of coils is higher than primary, we then say that the secondary Voltage is stepped up and the CURRENT lowers to keep Power constant, but isn't the output current dictated by the secondary LOAD? 

So if secondary Voltage increases(stepped up), shouldn't the secondary current be dictated by the load resistance in the secondary circuit?

2384,Does the force between 2 charges change due to a wall between them?," I am coming from a background in Thermal/CFD engineering (modeling) and am a novice at electric and magnetic fields and related subjects. So this may be a very basic or obvious question but I am not able to figure it out. Any explanation/guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to figure out if my understanding is correct from my studies and clarify a few points. 

[https://imgur.com/ycMAFAq](https://imgur.com/ycMAFAq)

 Consider 2 points at A and B with charges Q at each of them. Let the distance between them be 'r'. Let us assume there is no medium between them.

**Figure\_i questions**

a) Is the force on the charge at B calculated by coulomb law?

b) Am I correct in my understanding that electric field 'E' at point\_B is equal to the displacement field D (which would be equal to electric flux density)? (note:I am not sure if this depends on the charge at B so let us assume there is no charge at B)

**Figure\_ii questions**

Now, if a conducting wall of thickness 't' and infinite length is placed in between the

 2 charges. c) Is the 'net' electric field inside the wall is zero?

d) Am I correct in understanding that the electric displacement field 'D' at point B is same at that in Figure\_i?

e) Is the force and electric field E on the charge at B be the same or different from Figure\_i? If the field E is different how to calculate it and will it depend on the relative position of the wall (i.e. nearer to point A OR nearer to point B)?

**Figure\_iii questions**

Now let us consider the wall from figure\_ii is replaced by a dielectric wall of the same thickness 't' and of infinite length.

f) Am I correct in understanding that now there is a 'net' electric field inside the wall given by

[https://imgur.com/KeIc0oF](https://imgur.com/KeIc0oF)

 where P is the polarization and ϵϵ permittivity of the dielectric wall?

g) Will the force at point B be the same as that in figure\_i?

I understand how the doppler effect works, and have no doubt that stars moving away WOULD be red shifted. But doesn't the fact that the farther away we look the more red shifted a light source is imply that there could be some effect on light that is due to the distance / time that light travels?

As an analogy  the farther I look in earth's atmosphere, the less color saturated the objects appear to be - that's not due to anything about the objects themselves, it's because of the journey the light has to travel to get to me and the effects of the atmosphere.  The fact there is such a clear correlation between color saturation and distance would lead me to believe that the effect is because of the distance itself, not due to some other effect which causes objects that are further away to be less color saturated.  I'm not saying that's a possible explanation for the effect, just an analogy of the way you would interpret the data and whether the effect is due to some property of the source itself or a property of the journey the information takes to get to you.

2493,Could pregnancy possibly delay menopause?,"So I have a question that there may not even be an answer to. I doubt there would be any scientific studies on this as there would be too many variables to be able to control the study. But I am curious about what other think.

But let me explain a little better what I mean before answering.

There are a few scientific facts first:
1. When a woman is born she already has all the eggs she will ever have. Women do not produce more so that's it.
2. When a woman is pregnant she (typically) will stop ovulating for the duration of the pregnancy, and may not start again for up to a year after giving birth.

So let's say a woman has 10 healthy to term pregnancies. We can average that out to 18m per pregnancy where she does not ovulate. Over those 10 pregnancies that adds up to 15 years of not ovulating.

So theoretically could that delay her from starting menopause for up to 15 years?


Also please don't come at me over this question. I am being genuine in my curiosity here and just wondering what others opinions might be. And by no means am I planning on having a whole heap of children to try and delay my own menopause. I have 3 children and that is enough for me.

There are reasons why a centrifugal one is used as part of a turbocharger, but the scientific challenge really got to me. I'm even building an extra 4-axis lathe to mill the blisks for it.

Anyways. I have no problems with the design of the blades or the velocity triangles. BUT EVERY book about fluid dynamics or turbomachinery OMITS THE EXACT causal link of how a stator (if the compressor is of such design) creates pressure. It usually vaguely talks about the stator being a diffusor, but on the same time the flow area of the annular stream continually grows smaller and smaller through the compressor.

In other words: How does it work that a flow is diffused (subsonic design) and at the same time the flow area is reduced. Obviously this can't work the way I describe the question, but the phrasing of the question is well formed to exactly depict how much I understand and what's still missing.

So, what exact characteristic of the stator (is it the curvature, the thickness, the nozzle spatial geometry,...) causes the pressure to rise from the velocity AND how do I bring this in accordance of the steady reduction of flow are throughout the compressor?

2516,"What does it mean to say that ""our skin perceives infrared as heat""?","So I've heard this many times before in the context of astronomy and JWST and I realized that I don't quite understand the implications of this statement: ""we perceive infrared as heat"". Our eyes see visible light frequencies, we have detectors that capture this visible light emitted from far away and our brains process it and that's how we see the environment around us. But about our perception of infrared as ""heat"":

* Stars/flames that burn hotter appear blue, stars that are colder appear red. Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes? Since infrared is heat and blue stars are hotter, I would expect more infrared from blue stars. Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red? Or is ""heat"" and ""hot temperature"" not actually the same thing in this case?
* Our skin ""feels"" infrared as ""heat"". But does our skin only detect infrared by direct contact, so we have to be touching something to feel that it's ""hot"" and tense its temperature? Or does it also detect some infrared radiation going through vacuum/air? When we feel the heat from a glowing red heater for example, do we feel the infrared radiation emitted directly by the hot metal, or do we feel the direct contact with the hot air that was heated by this nearby element and traveled to us across the room?

Cholesterol in the bloodstream, specifically the bad LDL cholesterol, is what’s most important. And the biggest influence on blood cholesterol level is the mix of fats and carbohydrates in your diet—not the amount of cholesterol you eat from food.

From my (very limited) understanding, a big problem with reignition of a liquid-fuel rocket engine in space is the 'sloshing' of liquid within the tanks. 
When the engines are already fired it causes no issue, since the g-forces during acceleration keep the fuel at the 'bottom' of the tank, where the pump is.

But how is this risk, of the pumps running empty, mitigated during reignition? I can imagine you could give the rocket a ""push"" with reaction thrusters to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank and then start up the pumps, but I haven't managed to find any real literature addressing this problem.

(b/c high RBC turnover is an indication of something bad?) And what IS the percent of the population that has high RBC turnover?

Like, if you want to do a full analysis of variance of mortality as a function of HbA1c, you want to form a hierarchical model where you explain how variation of mortality explained by HbA1c is DIFFERENT between both high and low levels of HbA1c AND (through cohort matching) what percent of low HbA1c is due solely to high RBC turnover (high RBC turnover is presumably a bad thing).

723,"What is the maximum distance one can vertically ""suck"" water like a syringe?","Suppose I have the power to submerge a fourth of a vertical, circular tube 50 feet in diameter and 500 feet high inside a deep vat of water so that the base of the tube isn't touching the base of the vat. Then, suppose I insert a rigid seal with an airtight grip around the inner edges of the tube at its submerged base and then begin pulling upwards on the seal so that the seal makes its way up through the tube while maintaining its airtight seal. The tube would remain stationary, vertical, and partly submerged the whole time I pull the seal upwards. 

I'd imagine that pulling the airtight seal upward would create a vacuum under the seal that, as the seal rises, would draw in/""suck"" water into the tube from the vat. Would it then be possible that I pull the seal all the way up to the top of the 500 ft tube and create a water column that reaches the top of this 500 ft tube?

I'm reading Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos and at one point it says that marine iguanas dive underwater, scoop a large amount of algae and then bask in the sun to increase their body temperature until the algae have been boil and cooked, at which point they are soft enough to be digested. It even says that the digestive system forms a kind of pressure boiler.

I've found this fascinating, but I haven't been able to confirm it. I've seen many pictures of iguanas basking in the sun and information about how much and which kinds of algae they eat, but I find no mention of the boiling part.

759,What would the effects be of receding coastal waterlines on soil fertility?,"Full disclosure: This is for a D&D campaign and I just want to have some sense of verisimilitude in the setting. 

Imagine we have some sort of geological event which results in the water level plummeting, say, six feet over 50 years. My interest is specifically in soil fertility in ocean shorelines. It's not clear to me how the salt content of the water would contribute to soil fertility. In freshwater areas, I'd assume the exposed lakebed would be a very good growing medium, but would a seabed be too salty to grow anything?
